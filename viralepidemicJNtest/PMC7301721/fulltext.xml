H7N9 was found in a viraemic patient in Guangdong province, China. The present study aimed to clarify the pathogenic characteristics of HPAI H7N9. Virus was isolated from the plasma and sputum of the patient with HPAI H7N9. Liquid phase chip technology was used to detect the plasma cytokines from the infected patient and healthy controls. Mice were infected with strains A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) and A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) to observe the virus&#x02019;s pathogenic characteristics. Serum and brain tissue were collected at 2, 4, and 6 days after infection. The viruses in serum and brain tissue were detected and isolated. The two strains were infected into A549 cells, exosomes were extracted, and virus genes in the exosomes were assessed. Live virus was isolated from the patient&#x02019;s plasma. An acute cytokine storm was detected during the whole course of the disease. In animal experiments, A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) was more pathogenic than A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) and resulted in the death of mice. Live virus was isolated from infected mouse serum. Virus infection was also detected in the brain of mice. Under viral stress, A549 cells secreted exosomes containing the entire viral genome. The viraemic patient was confirmed to have an HPAI H7N9 infection. A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) showed significantly enhanced toxicity. Patient deaths might result from cytokine storms and brain infections. Extrapulmonary tissue infection might occur via the exosome pathway. The determined pathogenic characteristics of HPAI H7N9 will contribute to its future treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Highly pathogenic H7N9</kwd><kwd>viraemia</kwd><kwd>pathogenic characteristics</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>extrapulmonary infection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science and Technology Major Project for the Control and Prevention of Major Infectious Diseases in China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX10711001, 2018ZX10102001, 2017ZX10305501</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Science and Technology Major Project for the Control and Prevention of Major Infectious Diseases in China [grant number 2018ZX10711001], [grant number 2018ZX10102001], and [grant number 2017ZX10305501].

To date, five waves of H7N9 infection have caused more than 1500 severe human infections and the mortality remains high, with more than 600 deaths [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The threat of a fifth wave of H7N9 virus to public health was more serious than that of the first four waves. The potential mechanism of this phenomenon may be that the later H7N9 viruses had a stronger ability to bind human receptors than the early isolates [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Before 2017, the H7N9 viruses comprised low-pathogenic avian influenza A (LPAI) H7N9 viruses. The H7N9 virus was spread in poultry, waterfowl, and migratory birds. Patients with H7N9 infection commonly had a history of exposure to sick and dying poultry. No evidence of human-to-human transmission was found. In the beginning of 2017, a novel highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAI) H7N9 was identified in human cases [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since the first case of HPAI H7N9 infection, these HPAI H7N9 strains have caused human infection in 8 provinces [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in China, and 32 human cases were found to be caused by the HPAI H7N9 virus. Meanwhile, the HPAI H7N9 virus was continuously detected in poultry or environmental samples in 14 provinces. Approximately 60,000 poultry have died from HPAI H7N9 virus infections. The rapid growth of human cases and the geographical expansion of the HPAI H7N9 virus pose a great challenge to public health.</p><p>In a previous study of H5N1 virus infection, viraemia was detected in 82% of the fatal cases, but absent in nonfatal cases. High viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. Individuals with detectable H5N1 RNA in their blood also had higher pharyngeal viral loads than those without evidence of H5N1 RNA, suggesting that the presence of viral RNA in blood reflects an overall high viral burden, which commonly leads to high mortality [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Virus RNA in serum has also been detected in patients with severe pandemic H1N1 2009 infection [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our previous study, H7N9 was only detected in the respiratory tract and faeces. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for H7N9 was negative in the cerebrospinal fluid, urine, or blood of all patients [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, in another centre in Shanghai, virus RNA was detected from plasma in many patients, but with no correlation with clinical outcome. Viral RNA might represent non-infectious virus rather than infectious virus particles. No live viruses were isolated in the blood of these patients [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Genetic changes to viruses might change their behaviour and pathogenic characteristics [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We treated a 63-year-old male patient with HPAI H7N9 infection. This patient had onset symptoms of high fever (42&#x000b0;C), sore throat, cough, palpitations and shortness of breath on day 9. The patient went to the Guangzhou Eighth People&#x02019;s hospital and was admitted. This patient was severely infected and died 3 days after admission. We isolated H7N9 virus from the patient&#x02019;s plasma. Isolation of virus was important to prove whether the virus disseminates beyond the respiratory tract. HPAI H7N9 caused severe viraemia, which might result in intense inflammatory responses, contributing to the high mortality. When live virus was isolated in the blood, virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract became possible.</p><p>Exosomes play an important role in viral infection [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies have shown that exosomes often carry viral RNA and proteins [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, studies have shown that the exosomes can carry intact HIV, HAV, HCV, and Zika viruses, causing their transmission and infection [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref>]. Thus, exosomes have been confirmed as a route of virus transmission [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The H7N9 virus might also spread through via exosomes. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the novel pathogenic characteristics of highly pathogenic H7N9.</p></sec><sec id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The work was carried out in accordance with ethical guidelines of the Guangzhou Eighth People&#x02019;s hospital (Ethical approval No. 20170178). Sputum and plasma specimens were collected daily after admission. The patient&#x02019;s plasma remaining after routine testing was stored in a bio-sample banker. The normal plasma were collected from 10 volunteers (half male and half female). The median age of these volunteers was 26 (interquartile range 23&#x02013;28 year) year old. These volunteers came to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine for regular physical examination. After the physical examination, these volunteers were confirmed healthy. The remaining plasma after routine testing was stored and used in our study.</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2002"><title>Animal experimental ethical statement</title><p>Female specific-pathogen-free (SPF) BALB/c mice, aged 6&#x02013;8 weeks old, were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, China. All animal studies were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Zhejiang Province and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (Ethical approval No. 2017-402-1). All experiments with H7N9 virus were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory approved by the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (Permit No. 2015-15).</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2003"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>The Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK) and A549 cell line (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). The cell lines were propagated in growth medium containing Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM; Cat#11965092, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Cat#10100147, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO2. The A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus used in this study was isolated from a patient in Guangzhou, China, in 2017 (GenBank: MF455313- 455320). We isolated this virus from the patient&#x02019;s plasma. The A/Zhejiang /DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus was isolated from a patient in Zhejiang Province, China, in 2013 [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Virus stocks were propagated in the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs at 37&#x000b0;C for 72&#x02005;h. The allantoic fluid was harvested and tested using a haemagglutinin HA assay. Aliquots of the allantoic fluid containing the virus were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further use.</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2004"><title>Deep sequencing of the H7N9 virus isolated from the plasma</title><p>The viral RNA of the H7N9 virus was extracted using Trizol (Cat#15596-026, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) method. The concentration, purity, and integrity of total viral RNA were detected using a NanoDrop 2000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The sequencing library was constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-zero Gold (Cat# RS-122-2301, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and the process was conducted according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The library was constructed as follows: after digesting ribosomal RNA with Ribo-zero, the RNA was broken into fragments of about 350 nt using Fragment High Mix, and the sequencing library was constructed by synthesizing and purifying cDNA, terminal repair, adding poly-A tail, ligating sequencing connectors, and PCR amplification. After quality checking, the library was sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq Xten sequencer. The sequencing strategy generated 150&#x02005;bp paired ends (PE150).</p><p>Clean reads were obtained through data quality control and filtering of raw sequencing data using the NGSQC toolkit [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clean Reads were compared to the reference genome (A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus) using BWA software [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on the results of the comparison between the samples and the reference genome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) sites were detected using the Freebayes, and the snpEff software [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used for functional annotation of SNPs and INDELs. The screening criteria of SNPs and INDELs were that the number of covered reads was greater than five and the quality value was greater than 20.</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2005"><title>The viral replication capability</title><p>The TCID50 (Fifty percent tissue culture infective dose) assay was performed as described previously[<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The virus replication capability were valued using embryonated chicken eggs and A549 cells models. The two strains of viruses (both with the amount of 100 TCID50) were injected into 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs and cultured in incubator at 37&#x000b0;C for 72&#x02005;h. The replication capability of the two strains of viruses were measured by the quantity of RNA and TCID50 titre.</p><p>A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. When the cell density reached 70&#x000ad;&#x02013;80%, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove the bovine serum. The cells were then infected with the viruses (MOI=0.1). After the adsorption for 2&#x02005;h, the cells were washed three times with PBS. DMEM supplemented with 1% foetal bovine albumin and 1 &#x000b5;g/ml L-l-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) was added to the culture A549 cells for 48&#x02005;h when culturing the ZJU01 strain. DMEM supplemented with 1% foetal bovine albumin was added to the culture A549 cells for 48&#x02005;h while culturing the GZ8H002 strain. The virus culture supernatant was measured by the quantity of RNA and TCID50 titre.</p><p>After culture for 48&#x02005;h, the cells were washed twice with PBS slightly. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20&#x02005;min. After washed twice with PBS slightly, cells were penetrated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20&#x02005;min. Cells were again washed, blocked for 30&#x02005;min with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Cat#H1130, Solarbio, Tongzhou, Beijing, China) and incubated sequentially with 1:400 dilution of mouse anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein antibody (Cat#ab128193, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 1&#x02005;h. After washing 5 times with PBS, the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat#ab150133, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 1:500 dilution was used as the secondary antibody. After washing 5 times with PBS, DAPI (Cat#C0060, Solarbio, Tongzhou, Beijing, China) was used as the nuclear counterstain. After washing 5 times with PBS, the cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2006"><title>Virus inoculation</title><p>Mice were inoculated intranasally with 50&#x02005;&#x000b5;l 10<sup>4</sup> TCID50 A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) or the A/Zhejiang/ DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Cat#20012500BT, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) of the same volume was given to the mice in the control group. Mice were observed for illness, weight loss, and death post-infection. Then, the mice were sacrificed, and their serum was collected at 2, 4, and 6 days post-infection (dpi) . The lung and brain were removed. Part of the organ was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, while the other part was used to detect virus levels using quantitative PCR. An H7N9 nucleic acid quantitative detection kit (Cat#Z-RR-0309-02) and Influenza virus A Real time RT-PCR kit (Cat#RR-0051-01) were purchased from Zhijiang biological technology Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China.</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2007"><title>Isolation of the virus from mouse serum</title><p>The sera collected at 2, 4, and 6&#x02005;dpi were used to isolate the virus. About 100&#x02005;&#x000b5;l of serum was injected into the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. The embryonated chicken eggs were cultured in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C for 72&#x02005;h. The allantoic fluid was harvested and tested using an HA assay.

After infection, HPAI H7N9 virus replicates in the lung. Meanwhile, the patient suffered from persistent viraemia and a cytokine storm was observed his plasma. Live H7N9 virus was detected the patient&#x02019;s blood. These phenomena were confirmed using animal experiments. How is the virus transmitted from the lung to the blood? One possible explanation is that inflammation leads to the disruption of the lung-blood barrier. Another possibility is that the virus is released into the blood through via exosomes. When the H7N9 virus exists in the blood, the virus might cause extrapulmonary infection. We speculated that the virus could infect the brain, after observing this phenomenon in the mouse model (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). However, we could not confirm this because of the lack of brain tissue from the deceased patient.
<fig id="F0007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Working model of viraemia and extrapulmonary infection by HPAI H7N9.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="TEMI_A_1754135_F0007_OC"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="S004"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, HPAI H7N9 infection of a patient proved to be deadly. This patient presented with viraemia and died 3 days after admission. Whether there is live virus in the blood and whether it could lead to extrapulmonary infection have been two important questions. Previous studies detected viral RNA from LPAI H7N9, H5N1, and H1N1 infections [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. H5N1 can be transmitted in ferrets by transfusion [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, there has been no report of the isolation of the virus from the blood of patients with H7N9 infections. We successfully isolated the live virus from the patient&#x02019;s plasma. We confirmed that the A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus persisted in the blood with mouse experiments.</p><p>In the previous studies of H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus infection, viraemia was commonly existed in the fatal cases, but was absent in nonfatal cases [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In previous study of H7N9, the virus RNA could only be detected in the lethal cases [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The amount of RNA detected in H7N9 patients is very small, and there is no previous report about patient with H7N9 infection to be confirmed to have viraemia. While in highly pathogenic H7N9 infection the viraemia was confirmed, which makes a great difference. At present, the mortality rate of H7N9 is about 40%, while as reported the mortality rate of highly pathogenic H7N9 is as high as 50% [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We speculated that there is a relationship between viraemia and high mortality. But more experiments still need to be carried out to confirm this suggestion.</p><p>In our previous study, we observed that the levels of 34 of the 48 cytokines and chemokines tested were significantly elevated in plasma samples from patients infected with LPAI H7N9. We further found that the levels of MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, and SCGF-&#x003b2; were highly positively correlated to disease severity. In addition, the profile of mediators MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-&#x003b2;, IP-10, IL-18, and IFN-&#x003b3; is an independent outcome predictor [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cytokinemia was also observed in patients with H5N1 infection. The levels of IL-10, IL-6, and IFN-&#x003b3; were elevated in H5N1-infected individuals [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the present study, 32 cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated in the patient. Among them, the levels of ten cytokines and chemokines, including MIG, IL-1ra, IL-6, IP-10, IL-10, IFN-&#x003b3;, MCP-3, IL-18, HGF, and MCP-1, were dramatically higher (&#x0003e; 30-fold) in this patient compared with those in the healthy controls. The acute cytokinemia might lead to the patient&#x02019;s death. The similar phenomenon was also observed in the mouse experiment. The mice infected with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) suffered a persistent cytokinemia, which might be the cause of death.</p><p>Influenza virus infection of the respiratory tract is associated with a range of neurological complications. The incidence of severe pandemic H1N1 influenza-associated neurological complications was estimated to be 1.2 per 1,00,000 persons among children and Asian Pacific patients [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The H1N1 influenza virus has not been detected in patients&#x02019; cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, in a mouse experiment, H1N1 was found to infect many brain regions and induce neuropathological changes in neonatal mouse brains [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, Influenza virus has the possible ability to infect the brain [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, avian H7N9 virus could effectively infect human brain cells. Meanwhile, the virus could be transcribed, replicate its viral genome, and generate infectious progeny virus [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present study, we detected relatively high levels of virus RNA in brain of mice infected with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) and A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus. However, in the TCID50 test of the brain leachate, no H7N9 virus was found in the samples of mice infected with the A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) virus. By contrast, the TCID50 test was positive for A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) in the brain leachate at 6&#x02005;dpi. The brain pathological changes supported this finding. We identified high levels of virus replication in the brain. Furthermore, we isolated live virus from the brain leachate. The replication of virus in the brain could cause profound central nervous system injury. Observation of neurological changes caused by H7N9 virus infection deserves further attention when managing these patients.</p><p>However, we must say that we haven&#x02019;t fully revealed the potential mechanism behind this feature of the 2017 H7N9 strain. But we observed the GZ8H002 strain might have acquired the possible key molecular substitutions associated with increased virulence and transmissibility in mammals. As we know, the presence of KRTA insertion in the cleavage sites enhanced the extrapulmonary infection ability and virulence of HPAI virus [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This effect has been also confirmed in H5N1 and H7N7 [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Influenza related encephalitis has also been found in H5N1 infection [<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The mutation of K526R is related to the increase of virus replication ability and the mutation of M535L may increase the virus polymerase activity [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44&#x02013;46</xref>]. We found GZ8H002 strain has both K526R and M535L mutations. On the basis of the insertion of KRTA at HA cleavage site of highly pathogenic H7N9, cumulative effect may occur, which together leads to the enhancement of pathogenicity and neurotropism of highly pathogenic H7N9. But, more experiments are needed to confirm whether these mutations are essential for high virulence of highly pathogenic H7N9 virus.</p><p>Exosomes are cellular secreted vesicles that are free to enter cells in a receptor-independent manner. Exosomes have been found to be closely associated with viral infection [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and can carry large amounts of viral nucleic acid or protein components. Studies have demonstrated that exosomes can carry HIV, hepatitis C virus, HAV, and Zika virus, causing the virus to spread [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study, we used the A549 cell model and found that A549 cells secreted exosomes under viral pressure. Gene fragments of HPAI H7N9 virus were detected in these exosomes. In addition, after inoculating chicken embryos with these exosomes, we isolated the H7N9 virus, further supporting the hypothesis that exosomes carry the entire genome of the H7N9 virus or live virus. These findings suggested that H7N9 extrapulmonary infection might develop via the exosome pathway. However, confirmatory trials are required to further clarify whether exosomes are indeed a route to extrapulmonary infection.</p><p>In summary, the viraemic patient was confirmed to be infected with HPAI H7N9. Cytokine storms and potential brain infections might be the cause of patient death. Exosomes might be the pathway that leads to infection in extrapulmonary tissues.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Chenyu Yang in the Center of Cryo-Electron Microscopy (CCEM), Zhejiang University for her technical assistance with the transmission electron microscopy.
