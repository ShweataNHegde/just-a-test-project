However, compared with the several pathogenicity-related molecular markers that have been identified for influenza A virus (IAV), little is known about potential IBV pathogenicity-related markers. Here, although the IBV strain B/Anhui-Tunxi/1528/2014 (AH1528/14) exhibited a more efficient replication ability <italic>in vitro</italic> and higher pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with IBV strain B/Anhui-Baohe/127/2015 (AH127/15), only three amino acids differences (HA<sub>A390E</sub>, NA<sub>N342D</sub> and PB1<sub>V212I</sub>) were observed among their full genomes. The contributions of each amino acid difference to the virus pathogenicity were further investigated. Compared with the wild type IBV virus rAH127, the recombinant virus harbouring a single substitution of HA<sub>A390E</sub> had a similar phenotype, whereas the recombinant virus harbouring PB1<sub>V212I</sub> replicated to a moderately higher titre in both MDCK cells and in mice. Notably, the virus harbouring NA<sub>N342D</sub> showed significantly better growth properties in MDCK cells and higher fatality rates in mice. In addition, the presence of NA<sub>N342D</sub> dramatically enhanced the viral neuraminidase activity. In conclusion, our study identified a novel IBV molecular marker, NA<sub>N342D</sub>, that could significantly increase the virulence of IBV in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Influenza B virus (IBV)</kwd><kwd>neuraminidase</kwd><kwd>pathogenicity</kwd><kwd>molecular marker</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza B virus (IBV) and influenza A virus (IAV) (H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) are currently co-circulating widely in human populations, leading to annual epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality. IBV infections account for 20%-30% of total seasonal influenza cases [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In some influenza seasons, the IBV detection rate and disease burden were even higher than those of IAV. For example, from 2002 to 2003, the mortality rate of IBV infections was as high as 78% in the United States [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During the 2017/2018 season, 60% and 54.3% of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections were associated with IBV in Europe[<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and China [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], respectively. Thus, in addition to IAVs, IBVs also pose a great threaten to public health.</p><p>The key genetic determinants that contribute to viral adaptation and pathogenicity in IAV have been broadly investigated in numerous studies. A substitution from E to K at position 627 in the PB2 protein significantly increased the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in mice [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. A D701N mutation in the PB2 protein led to effective viral replication and enhanced the pathogenicity of both AIVs and swine influenza virus in mammals [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other molecular markers involved with IAV mammalian adaptation have been identified as well, including PB2<sub>Q591K</sub> [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], PB2<sub>A588V</sub> [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and NPQ35<sub>7K</sub> [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the molecular determinants of IBV pathogenicity are relatively poorly understood. Currently, the identifications of IBV pathogenic determinants were exclusively performed by serially lung-lung passaged in mouse model. Mccullers et al. [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that after serial passages of an initially avirulent IBV in mice, a selected variant that was lethal to mice was appeared. Sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that M1<sub>N221S</sub> was responsible for the acquisition of virulence and lethality. Bae et al. [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that compared with wild-type viruses, two mouse-adapted IBVs generated by passages through mice both harboured the mutation PA<sub>K338R</sub>. Further study showed that PA<sub>K338R</sub> alone could increase the pathogenicity of IBVs in mice. Another study performed by Kim et al. [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] identified multiple adaptive mutations of IBV, including HA<sub>D424G</sub>, M1<sub>N240T</sub>, M2<sub>N14S</sub>, NP<sub>K294N</sub>, and PA<sub>V609I</sub>. The combination of these mutations significantly enhanced viral replication in mice and viral transmission in ferrets.</p><p>IBVs were classified into two antigenically-distinct lineages in the 1970s, including B/Victoria and B/Yamagata [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Both lineages have co-circulated during each influenza season since at least 2001, and they are usually alternately dominant [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In mainland China, B/Yamagata lineage viruses showed higher levels of epidemic activity compared with B/Victoria lineage viruses and led to three major epidemics during the 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2017/2018 seasons [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the evolution and biological characteristics of B/Yamagata lineage viruses, and further investigated their pathogenicity determinants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials methods" id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="S002-S2001"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All mouse experiments and the related animal care and handling, including mice housing, feeding, virus infection and sample collection were approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC (20190212004).

It cleaves sialic acid from the cell surface during the final stages of the replication cycle, enabling the release of progeny virions [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For IAVs, an increased NA activity is correlated with the release of influenza viral RNA-containing particles into the air. Higher NA enzyme activity in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses increased the release of virus particles and therefore improved virus transmissibility [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. K110E mutation in NA significantly promoted NA enzyme activity and enhanced mice pathogenicity combined with PB2 mutations in H10N7 [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For IBV, a previous study found that a single substitution from D to N at position 457 of NA destroyed the salt bridge acting as a contact surface between the monomers. Thus, this change caused a significant loss in enzymatic activity but did not impact viral replication <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study, based on a 3D structure analysis, reside 342 in the NA protein is located closely to the enzyme active site (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(A)), and NA<sub>N342D</sub> mutation did increase the neuraminidase activity (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(B)). It could be one of the causative factors for why NA<sub>N342D</sub> could dramatically increased IBV virulence.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that NA<sub>N342D</sub> could significantly enhance the viral infectivity, replication, and pathogenicity of IBVs. The identification of this novel pathogenicity determinant of IBVs could provide novel insight into future pathogenicity studies and surveillance of IBVs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (81971941, 31761133003 and 81961128002), and the National Mega-projects for Infectious Diseases (2017ZX10104001002002).
