Accurate
and early detection of infectious pathogens are crucial for transmission control, clinical
diagnosis, and therapy. For a traditional reason, most immunological and microbiological
laboratories are equipped with instruments designated for antibody-based assays in
detection of infectious pathogens or clinical diagnosis. Emerging aptamer-based
technologies have pushed a shift from antibody-based to aptamer-based assays due to equal
specificity, even better sensitivity, lower manufacturing cost and more flexibility in
amending for chemiluminescent, electrochemical or fluorescent detection in a multifaceted
and high throughput fashion in comparison of aptamer-based to antibody-based assays. The
nature of aptamer-based technologies is particularly suitable for point-of-care testing in
remote areas at warm or hot atmosphere, and mass screening for potential infection in
pandemic of emerging infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in an epicentre or
other regions. This review intends to summarize currently available aptamer-based
technologies in detection of bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens for research and
clinical application. It is anticipated that potential technologies will be further
optimized and validated for clinical translation in meeting increasing demands for prompt,
precise, and reliable detection of specific pathogens in various atmospheric
conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Aptamer</kwd><kwd>HBV</kwd><kwd>HCV</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>leishmania</kwd><kwd>amoeba</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>In a highly mobile, interdependent but interrelated world, infectious diseases spread so
rapidly that they pose a serious global threat to public health [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Rapid, convenient, and high-throughput testing is a key to
control the transmission of emerging infectious agents. Antibodies have been used in
microbial immunoassay for more than 50 years [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
Their inherent ability to bind microbial preparations and their products makes them ideal to
capture molecules for immunoassay, such as ELISA, immunochromatographic bands, column
chromatography, and immunosensor development [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, there is an increasing
need for affordable, rapid, sensitive, and high throughput methods in identifying new or
re-emerging infectious agents or distinguishing resistant subclones.</p><p>Nucleic acid aptamer is small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA, identified and selected
from a synthetic oligonucleotide library with a length of 20&#x02013;80 bases via systematic
evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) or other modified SELEX strategies
[<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Aptamers have been considered to be
&#x0201c;artificial antibodies,&#x0201d; and considerable attention has been given to nucleic acid aptamers
because of their low production cost, easy chemical modification, high chemical stability
and binding affinity, repeatability, and reusability. It may be folded into secondary and
tertiary spatial structure with a combination of loops, stems, hairpins, pseudoknots, bumps,
or G-quadruplexes. This feature gives them high specificity and affinity to a variety of
targets, ranging from ions to molecules of various properties, sizes, and complexities
throughout a cell, including small molecules (such as amino acids, nucleotides,
antibiotics), macromolecules (peptides, proteins, nucleic acids), or whole viruses,
bacteria, and cells, etc. The advantages of aptamers in biological use are concisely
highlighted in <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Aptamers are equally
applicable in many assays where antibodies are used, and they are even more flexible and
amendable when real-time detection is needed or for on-site detection when a refrigerator is
unavailable. Those advantages make it possible to be a detecting probe for infectious
agents. <table-wrap id="T0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Bullet points for aptamer advantages.</title></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="1*"/><tbody><tr><td align="left"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>High affinity with dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) in a

design of biosensors applicable in infectious diseases over the past 20 years. The
technology of detecting infectious diseases based on aptamers has achieved tremendous
progress and is becoming a promising detection strategy in recent 10 years. Since its first
application in 1990 [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], SELEX has undergone many
modifications. The novel modification makes the obtained aptamer more specific, the
selection process more efficient, cost-effective, and greatly reduces time consumption
[<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Specific aptamers for infectious
microorganisms in the event of new epidemic outbreaks can be quickly obtained through
efficient SELEX technology, such as the recent specific aptamers of SARS-CoV-2 have been
obtained rapidly [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Once the specific aptamers
of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxic molecules are identified, a variety of detection
schemes can be designed based on the aptamers, including chemiluminescent, electrochemical
or fluorescent detection according to the different detection signals [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref>]. In order to improve
the sensitivity of aptamer-based detection, several research teams tried to develop signal
amplification strategies. Three methods, catalytic molecule, cyclic enzymatic, and
rolling-circle amplification (RCA) are used to amplify signals for better detection and a
breakthrough has been made in the sensitivity of aptamer-based infectious agents detection
[<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>]. Through the
acquisition of specific aptamers of pathogenic microorganisms and the establishment of
sensitive and stable aptamer-based detection methods, it is possible to diagnose infectious
agents conveniently, quickly, and effectively in any environment.</p><p>This review intends to provide an update in the use of aptamer-based technologies in
detection of infectious agents, and to demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of
these technologies in precise detection of many categories of microbial agents, such as
pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites or their products in a solid or liquid phase (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In-depth technical overviews regarding
emerging aptamer-based biosensors and cutting-edging technologies for the detection of
proteins from various pathogens are available [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Representative aptamer-based
methods for pathogenic targets from recent literature are briefly discussed in the text and

diagnostic methods, including tuberculin skin test, tuberculosis antibody detection, and
M. TB microscopic examination, have some shortcomings, such as low sensitivity, poor
specificity, long-term process, false positive, or negative results. There is an urgent
demand to develop reliable, sensitive, stable, and less costive tests for early diagnosis
of tuberculosis in resource-deficient communities. To achieve rapid and secure methods for
early diagnosis in resource-deficient communities, two diagnostic tests based on DNA
aptamers were developed, namely aptamer connection fixation adsorption analysis
(AptamerAlisa) and electrochemical sensor (ECS), for tuberculosis biomarker HspX in sputum
[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A blinded clinical study in 314 sputum
samples demonstrated that the sensitivity of AptamerAlisa (94.1%) was better than the
anti-HspX polyclonal antibody-based ELISA (68.2%), without affecting the detection
specificity of 100%. It was proven that aptamer-based detection was superior to smear
microscope, antibody-based ELISA, and chest X-ray in the detection of tuberculosis. In
addition, a 30-minute care-point ECS assay was developed to distinguish between
tuberculous and non-tuberculous sputum with 92.3% sensitivity and 91.2% specificity in 57
culture-negative and 13 culture-positive sputum samples. Therefore, the biosensor has
potential usefulness in detecting active cases in high-risk groups and in screening for
tuberculosis in suspected subjects.</p><p>Synthetic aptamers combined with co-adsorbents on a gold electrode were optimized to
detect secretory protein MPT64, which is a highly immunogenic peptide and pathogenic
factor of M. TB, with a detection limit of 81 pMol in serum samples, and reduce the
detection time from a few days or hours to 30&#x02005;min [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A new sandwich electrochemical body-fitted sensor was also developed for
determination of MPT64 [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Under an optimal
condition, the proposed aptasensor showed a wide linear range for MPT64 from 1&#x02005;fg/mL to
1&#x02005;ng/mL with a detection limit as low as 0.33&#x02005;fg/mL, which indicates a broad usage in
clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.</p><p>Taking together, aptamer-based innovations hold a great potential as rule-in as well as
rule-out screening tests with high sensitivity and specificity. The maturation and
translation of these innovations would aid in high-throughput and on-site screening of TB
infection in communities with disparity.</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2002"><title>Salmonella</title><p>Salmonella infection caused by contaminated food has been going on for decades because
hundreds of thousands of patients are infected worldwide each year. Therefore, the
detection of salmonella in contaminated food is a critical preventive measure in public
health. A broad-spectrum ssDNA aptamer containing 80 nucleotides (LA80) capable of binding
to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from four different sources, was truncated to a 27-nt aptamer
(LA27) and then developed to detect LPS from <italic>salmonella

Antibody-immobilized immunomagnetic beads are used to capture <italic>L.

is one of the critical factors in controlling broad transmission and treating infected
individuals [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Viral proteins involved in

targets for aptamer selection and optimization. At present, a number of aptamers have been
reported to hold potential applications in the diagnosis of viral infections, such as human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human
papillomavirus (HPV), influenza virus, norovirus, or SARS-CoV (<xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A fast and sensitive detection kit with high specificity
is urgently desirable for global SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large population.</p><sec id="S003-S2001"><title>Human immunodeficiency virus</title><p>HIV is the main cause of AIDS, and leads to significant morbidity and mortality. As
highly effective antiretroviral therapy (HAART) cannot completely eradicate silent

pathophysiologic mechanisms of controlling reactivation during or after HAART therapy.
Several crucial viral proteins such as Gp120, Gag polyprotein, Rev and enzymes like
reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase, and proteases have been considered to be the
targets of detection [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A novel molecularly
imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemiluminescence (MIP-ECL) sensor was developed for the
detection of highly sensitive and selective HIV-1 genes using europium sulphide
nanocrystalline (ESNC) as signal generation compounds [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With MIP-ECL and ESNC strong electronic chemiluminescent emission, the
sensitive and selective detection of HIV gene was achieved in the linear range of 3.0
fMol&#x0223c;0.3 nMol, and the detection limit was 0.3 fMol. Compared to non-complementary
sequences and two base mismatch sequences, the current MIP-ECL biosensors demonstrate high
specificity in HIV gene detection. The proposed ECL biosensor has been applied to the
detection of HIV proviral DNA in human serum samples with satisfactory results. Because of
its high sensitivity, selectivity, repeatability, and stability, ESNCs may be used as a

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and there is no approved vaccine. Ten viral proteins were
produced from a 3000-amino-acid polyprotein during the maturation mediated by protease,
and these structural or nonstructural proteins or viral enzymes are the targets of
specific aptamers [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Aptamer-based
biosensors allow the detection of HCV infection at an early stage. By an aptamer proximity

detection of HCV core antigen [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The
immobilized surface was prepared by modifying glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with graphene
quantum dots (GQD). Through &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; stacking, the richness of hydrophilic edge and hydrophobic
surface in GQD and the hydrophobic plane in GQD enhance the adsorption of aptamer on the
electrode surface, thus introducing a new substrate suitable for nucleic acid aptamer.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential
pulse voltammetry (DPV) were performed at each stage of the chemical modification to
confirm the resulting surface changes. With EIS as an effective alternative system for the
detection of the core antigen, two linear concentration ranges are 10&#x02013;70 and 70&#x02013;400&#x02005;pg/ml

competition between HPV-16-L1 aptamers and melamine adsorbed on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)
[<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The intensity of the MS signal
corresponding to the mass tag has a linear relationship with the HPV-16-L1 concentration

discovery lead time were overcome by developing slow abscission rate-modified DNA aptamer
(SOMAmer), which targets antigens in the HPV vaccine [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. An HPV-07 aptamer was selected to bind to the type 16 virus-like particle
(VLP) formed by the self-assembled capsid protein L1. The HPV-07 aptamer binds to a
similar or closely related epitope as the neutralizing antibody H16.V5, indicating at
least part of the recognition of clinically relevant epitopes. When used in an ELISA
format, the aptamer exhibited both high precision (with a medium precision of 6.3%) and a
large linear range from 25% to 200% of the typical formula. In order to make further use
of the aptamer, a simplified hybrid assay is developed. Compared with the traditional
ELISA, this assay provides a significant reduction in time. These results demonstrate that
aptamers are suitable reagents for biotiter determination, and hopefully their

25 million people [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] around the world. The
rapid detection and classification of influenza viruses are particularly important because
these viruses have a high risk of infection and high-frequency mutations, which often lead
to the arrival of new strains, resulting in epidemics and even pandemics. Paper-based
lateral &#x0fb02;ow immunoassays (LFIA) using traditional sandwich immunoassay is one of the most
commonly used hospice tests. The application of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in LFIA cannot
meet the sensitivity requirements for the detection of infectious agents or biomarkers at
low concentration in body fluids because of the number of AuNPs that bind to the target is
limited. In order to overcome this problem, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein
(DNA-binding domain of RPA70A, human replicative protein A70kDa A) was acquired, which
uses capture antibodies and aptamers fixed in LFIA as probes for sandwich detection [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, the signal strength was enhanced by
connecting several AuNPs to each aptamer. This method was to detect influenza
nucleoprotein (NP) and cardiac troponin I (CTnI). The detection limits of AuNP in human
nasal fluid and CTnI in serum were 0.26 and 0.23&#x02005;pg/mL, respectively. This technique
demonstrates significantly higher sensitivity than conventional methods that are widely
used in LFIA involving antibody binding to AuNPs. These results underscore that the
proposed method is widely applicable in the detection of highly sensitive substances in
the field of POC for early diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="S003-S2005"><title>Norovirus for acute gastroenteritis</title><p>Human norovirus (NoV) is the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide, and

noroviral genome is positive single-stranded RNA enclosed in an icosahedral capsid
consisting of capsid viral protein 1 (VP1) and VP2. The capsid is thermal-resistant,
allowing the virus to survive in temperatures up to 55&#x000b0;C and a pH range of 3&#x02013;7. The
current diagnostic method is nucleotide-based RT&#x02013;PCR detection of the viral RNA. However,
one kit may not cover different genetic strains of the virus, and it is less convenient
for point-of-care detection. To meet this need, specific aptamer against VP1 was
identified [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the SELEX screening
stringency was enhanced by adding food matrices in the system in order to enhance the
aptamer specificity against viral P domain containing the outermost domain of the VP1

point-of-care device for rapid determination of noroviruses was successfully developed
with a previously characterized aptamer against NoV [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. An easy-to-make paper-based microfluidic platform was further developed
using a nitrocellulose membrane and integration of 6-FAM-labeled aptamer. The noroviral

norovirus and detection limits at 3.3&#x02005;ng/mL. The device is simple and cost-effective, and
holds great potential of rapid <italic>in situ</italic> visual determination
of noroviruses with desirable sensitivity and specificity. Hence, this aptasensor- and
paper-based microfluidic device provides a new method for early identification of
norovirus. Moreover, a micro&#x0fb02;uidic platform integrated with graphene-gold nano-composite
aptasensor was reported [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and the latter
had a detection limit of 100 pM with a detection range from 100&#x02005;pM to 3.5&#x02005;nM for
norovirus. Therefore, the aptamer-based noroviral detection is evolving, and it is

parasite-bead aggregates are separated from whole blood samples with parasite spines, even

For these two methods, biomarkers are captured from serum samples with aptamer-coated

The novel techniques provide the detection of specific biomarkers in a clinically relevant

antibodies in developing aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) for detection of microbial
components in a specific, quick, and sensitive fashion, and some of them are operative in
remote areas in meeting the need for point-of-care testing. Through a SELEX screening and
enriching process, target-specific aptamers are selected with high efficiency, and are
flexible for conjugation of a variety of sensor molecules to facilitate chemiluminescent or
fluorescent measurement, to link them to solid phases or nanoparticles for visualization or

con&#x0fb01;gurations, including electrochemical, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or mass-sensitive,
etc. Moreover, for emerging viral pathogens, such as, influenza, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in
a pandemic period, a quick, simple, and reliable approach is in an urgent need for mass
population screening of infected individuals. Aptasensor-based technologies for detecting
biomarkers at pMol levels enable such a screening or diagnosis possible at a low cost in
point-of-care sites. The expansion of aptasensor-based technologies in the infectiology

highly-specific aptamers for a particular target, such as bacterial or viral components on
an individual base. In most cases, microbial pathogens, their enzymes, structural or
nonstructural proteins are the targets for the development of specific aptamers. However,
when bacterial or viral targets bear significant negative charges, it will enhance the
difficulty to enrich highly-specific aptamer candidates through an SELEX process [<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], because oligonucleotide-based aptamers have
negative charges on their backbone [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To
obtain highly-specific aptamer candidates, the stringency of a SELEX selection process is
critical, and negative and countermeasures may be often introduced to exclude low affinity
or non-specific aptamers [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. At the same time,
an introduction of additional counter steps might have a negative impact by increasing the
time and cost for an overall selection process [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, enriched aptamers need a rigorous validation and optimization for
target specificity and sensitivity. The additional obstacles for aptamer-based biosensors
are the stability of aptamers, because nucleotide aptamers will be subjected to degradation
by ribonuclease in the serum, although special modification, for instance, phosphorothioate
modification, may enhance the resistance to nuclease degradation. Currently, most
immunological or microbiologic laboratories are equipped with instruments that are specially
designed for antibody-based detection. For switching to aptamer-based detection requires
pharmaceutical industries, clinical, and research laboratories for new investments on both
technology development and equipment design and validation. Such a transition is happening,
although slowly. In spite of all challenges mentioned above, compelling advantages over
antibody-based assays, such as relatively low cost for manufacture, multiplexity, and high
throughput in nature, have pushed the maturation of aptamer-based technologies and
translation to clinical practice, especially in mass screening for pandemic transmission of
emerging pathogens, such as SARS-Cov-2 in heavily affected areas. It is anticipated that
both antibody- and aptamer-based technologies will be widely utilized in the detection of
microbial components for research, epidemical investigation and clinical services or food
and environmental monitoring with almost equal specificity and sensitivity. Ultimately,
aptamer-based technologies may be more acceptable for point-of-care testing due to their
more flexibility for modification and stability in a warm or hot atmosphere.</p><p>In conclusion, taking the advantages of high sensitivity, reproducibility, specificity, and
time-saving, novel aptamer-based technologies are considered as the most promising methods
to detect a wide range of pathogens and biochemical components in food safety, environment
surveillance, and diagnosis of infectious diseases at the point-of-care and resource-poor
settings. As emerging technologies, their maturation and translation to the clinical
application need rigorous optimization and validation for the high quality of service
demanded in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="S006"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>BS</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Juhas</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group>
