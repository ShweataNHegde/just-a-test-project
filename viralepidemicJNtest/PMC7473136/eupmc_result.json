    "Recent studies have identified host long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as key regulators of host-virus interactions during viral infection. The influenza A virus (IAV) remains a serious threat to public health and economic stability. It is well known that thousands of lncRNAs are differentially expressed upon IAV infection, some of which regulate IAV infection by modulating the host innate immune response, affecting cellular metabolism, or directly interacting with viral proteins. Some of these lncRNAs appear to be required for IAV infection, but the molecular mechanisms are not completely elucidated. In this review, we summarize the roles of host lncRNAs in regulating IAV infection and provide an overview of the lncRNA-mediated regulatory network. The goal of this review is to stimulate further research on the function of both well-established and newly discovered lncRNAs in IAV infection."
