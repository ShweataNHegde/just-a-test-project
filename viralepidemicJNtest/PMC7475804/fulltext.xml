syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a global public health concern [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The number of pregnant women and neonate with
COVID-19 is also on the rise [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A recent study reported a newborn with elevated
IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 born to a mother with COVID-19 [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Vertical transmission of SARS-Cov-2 and transplacental
transmission of antibodies have been proposed with controversial opinions [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. Although clinical and
laboratory characteristics, and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 have been reported
[<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], there are no continuously monitored data
about the viral loads in several body fluids of the maternal women that would bring
potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection to neonates [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Here, we follow up the viral loads and antibody titers of SARS-Cov-2 in a
maternal woman and the neonate since be hospitalized to discharged.</p><p>On February 26, 2020, a 33-year-old primiparous woman (38 weeks 2 days of gestation with
irregular lower abdominal pain with vaginal fluid for 6 h) suffering from cough and chest
tightness 2 weeks ago was admitted to hospital for childbirth. Chest radiography showed
patchy ground-glass opacities in the periphery of left lung (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, panel A), and a throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2
through reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) at admission
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, panel B). Laboratory test abnormalities
included the decrease of lymphocyte percentage (15.6%), increase of neutrophil percentage
(80%), and elevated serum levels of hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 90 U/L,
aspartate aminotransferase 81.8 U/L; Supplementary table). The maternal woman was considered
as an ordinary case base on mild symptoms and radiologic imaging. <fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and IgG antibody in samples from the maternal

The woman gave birth in a negative-pressure operating room. All persons in the room wore
protective suits and the maternal woman wear an N95 mask immediately after labor. The infant
girl was delivered by Left Occiput Anterior (LOA) in isolation delivery room and quarantined
in the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU). The infant&#x02019;s birth weight was 2950&#x02005;g, and Apgar
scores were 9 at 1 min and 10 at 5 min. An oropharyngeal swab specimen, obtained immediately
after she was taken from the uterus, showed a negative result for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The infant was then sent to the negative-pressure ward. After delivery, the
woman was transferred to the ICU isolation ward to continue treatment with anti-infective
medication (Azithromycin and Ornidazole). On March 7, the woman was transferred to Guanggu
Branch of Hubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital, a designated hospital for COVID-19
treatment in Wuhan city.</p><p>With the use of RT&#x02013;PCR assays, the mother&#x02019;s throat swabs were continuously positive, and
the CT value remains low for SARS-CoV-2 by RT&#x02013;PCR at March 8, 12 and 15, and turned negative
since March 18, while all samples of breast milk, urine, vaginal secretion, feces, tear,
sweat and blood serially collected during the same period were negative (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, panel B). Through Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISAs) using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as antigen, the titers of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2
in serum were 4509.5, 4025.4, 3683.6, 5838.6, 3690.1, respectively (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, panel C). The titers of IgG antibody in breast milk were
2.34, 3.02, 2.84, 2.79, and 3.35, respectively, when three SARS-CoV-2 negative maternal
woman&#x02019;s breast milk were tested as control (mean titer 0.98) (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, panel D). Breastfeeding protects infants against
infections mainly via secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies. In the early stages of lactation,
IgA, anti-inflammatory factors and, more likely, immunologically active cells provide
additional support for the immature immune system of the neonate. Here we determined the
antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk by ELISA. The titers of IgA antibody in breast milk
were 2.18, 2.23, 2.37 and 2.69, respectively, when three SARS-CoV-2 negative maternal
woman&#x02019;s breast milk was tested as control (Mean titer 0.9) (Supplementary figure).</p><p>On March 22, the mother was discharged, with her abnormal chest radiography and laboratory
test findings recovered to normal, and the neonate had a negative result for detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the throat swab and IgG titer of 1675.5 in serum, which was lower than her
mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). On April 9, the mother&#x02019;s IgG
antibody remained a titer of 4066.6 in serum and elevated to 13.9 in breast milk, but the
neonate&#x02019;s IgG turned negative (Figure, panel D and E). And the titer of IgA antibody was
slightly elevated to 4.01 in breast milk (Supplementary figure).</p><p>Although the SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in breast milk in recent publication [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in our study there is no detection of SARS-CoV-2
in the mother&#x02019;s body fluids serially collected after delivery when her throat swabs showing
positive results for SARS-CoV-2, especially in breast milk. The neonate had negative result
for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the birth and her IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was observed only within
one and half month after birth, indicating the placenta transmission of COVID antibody. The
mother&#x02019;s IgG antibody usually remains in neonate for more than 6 months after birth. Infants
incapable of producing immunoglobulins are protected by maternal antibodies for up to 12
months after birth [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], however, our follow-up
identified that IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in the neonate maintained less than one and half month,
suggesting the potential risk for subsequent COVID-19 in neonates. More importantly, the IgG
and IgA antibodies were detected in breast milk indicate the potential immune protection for
the neonates. Nonetheless, data from large-scale cohort are warranted.</p></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We thank Tao Jiang, PhD, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing,
