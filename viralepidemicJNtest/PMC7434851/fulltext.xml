SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic, leading to about 10 million confirmed cases and ~500 thousand deaths. COVID-19 is thought to be the second most widespread infectious disease since the 1918 flu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and has promoted the global collaboration of clinicians and scientists to investigate the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and to understand genomic and structural information regarding SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> However, some challenging and critical questions, including the roles of cytokine storm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> SARS-CoV-2 tropism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and virus&#x02013;host interaction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> remain unanswered, and antiviral drugs and vaccines have not been developed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> which requires an animal model that can recapitulate the important features of COVID-19 in patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> In fact, several animal models of COVID-19 were recently reported; these models include hACE2-transgenic mouse models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> a non-transgenic mouse model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> a golden hamster model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> a ferret model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and nonhuman primate (NHP) models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> However, in addition to the different genetic backgrounds of the experimental animals, the use of different viral strains, dosages and routes of challenge in these models resulted in different and even controversial conclusions. Therefore, in this study, three species of NHPs were challenged with the same strain of SARS-CoV-2 to identify the suitability of NHP models of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">To determine the suitability of NHP species for modeling COVID-19, we experimentally inoculated three species of monkeys belonging to two families (Old World and New World monkeys) with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) according to the methods described for a reported SARS model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> followed by comprehensive comparisons of the clinical signs of COVID-19, viral shedding and replication, and host responses to viral infection.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of the study design and clinical signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in monkeys. <bold>a</bold> Three species of monkeys from two families of nonhuman primates (26 animals in total) were selected for this comparative study to assess their ability to model COVID-19. Age and sex were considered for grouping of the monkeys. After the collection of baseline samples on day 0, all animals were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, as stated in the &#x0201c;Materials and methods&#x0201d; section. Clinical signs, viral shedding and replication, and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 were recorded at the indicated time points and evaluated. <bold>b</bold> The body temperature of each monkey was monitored and recorded every two days after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. The body temperature changes were calculated by subtracting the baseline from each body temperature. The figure was prepared by the Graphpad Prism software. <bold>c</bold> Chest radiographs of SARS-CoV-2-challenged monkeys were taken every two days with a mobile digital medical X-ray photography system. Radiographs were independently graded by two thoracic radiologists in a double-blind manner via a four-pattern approach, as described in the &#x0201c;Materials and methods&#x0201d; section.

Increases in body temperature of more than 0.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C were observed in 11 out of 14 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> (HHH-1&#x02013;HHH-14), 4 out of 6 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic> (SXH-1&#x02013;SXH-6) and 3 out of 6 <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> (RH-1&#x02013;RH-6) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Notably, <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> SXH-6 showed a continuously high body temperature over the 21-day experimental period. The loss of body weight (BW) was noticed at 10 days post inoculation (dpi), when 11 out of 13 <italic>M. mulatta</italic> showed a decrease in BW by 5.88&#x02013;28.57%. Five out of six <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> showed a decrease in BW by 2.17&#x02013;10.51% (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), suggesting more severe loss of BW in <italic>M. mulatta</italic> than in <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>.</p><p id="Par5">Next, the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the lung were evaluated on the basis of chest radiographs using a four-pattern approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> We observed lung abnormalities in the form of nodules, masses, and interstitial patterns in both <italic>M. mulatta</italic> and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> at 12 dpi. In particular, aged <italic>M. mulatta</italic> showed more interstitial patterning than young or adult <italic>M. mulatta</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Importantly, overall comparison of the chest radiographs showed that the pulmonary abnormalities were more severe in <italic>M. mulatta</italic> than in <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>, suggesting that <italic>M. mulatta</italic> are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>. However, no other respiratory symptoms were observed in any of the three monkey species during this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in monkeys</title><p id="Par6">Furthermore, we studied the kinetics of infection by monitoring viral shedding from the respiratory and alimentary tracks and replication in tissues at the indicated time points after infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Nasal swab samples from all three species of monkeys showed peaks in the levels of viral genomic RNA (~&#x02009;5.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> copies/&#x003bc;l) at 2 dpi, followed by two smaller peaks from 6 to 8 dpi. Viral RNA was still detectable in some of the swab samples from Old World monkeys taken at 14 dpi. In contrast, we found lower viral RNA levels in the swab samples from <italic>C. jacchus</italic>. In the peripheral blood, viral RNA levels were very low but detectable in the majority of monkeys at 2 dpi and disappeared from blood samples taken from nearly all monkeys at 10 dpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Moreover, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in various tissues of the infected monkeys. Viral RNA was detected in the following ten tissues from two <italic>M. mulatta</italic> (HHH-13 and HHH-14) necropsied at the early stage of infection: the lung, trachea, bronchia, spleen, stomach, rectum, bladder, uterus, hilar lymph node, and mesenteric lymph node. However, at the late stage of infection, viral RNA was found in only the bronchus, laryngopharynx, and spleen of <italic>M. mulatta</italic> and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Viral RNA and spike protein levels in respiratory tissue samples were confirmed by RNA hybridization with the RNAscope platform (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and immunofluorescent assays (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We did not find viral RNA in any of the 16&#x02013;18 tissues collected from the RH2 and RH5 strains of <italic>C. jacchus</italic>. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could replicate in multiple tissues of model <italic>M. mulatta</italic> and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> and that in addition to the respiratory route, the fecal&#x02013;oral route may be involved in viral transmission.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Viral shedding and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in NHPs. <bold>a</bold> Every other day after virus inoculation, swab (nasal, throat, and anal), feces, and blood samples were collected from the monkeys for the quantification of virus genomic RNA via RT-qPCR.

We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the production of virus-specific antibodies in the majority of monkeys, with these antibodies becoming detectable at 4 dpi (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). Overall, antibody levels in old and adult <italic>M. mulatta</italic> were higher than those in young <italic>M. mulatta</italic>. Consistent with the results of virus monitoring, we did not detect virus-specific antibodies in serum samples from infected <italic>C. jacchus</italic>. Neutralization assays revealed that virus-specific antibodies from most of the animals had neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, with the highest viral titer (1:256) observed in <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> at 21 dpi (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antibody responses of <italic>M. mulatta</italic> (<bold>a</bold>) and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> (<bold>b</bold>) to viral infection were evaluated with total virus-specific antibody ELISA kits. Inflammatory cytokines in serum samples from <italic>M. mulatta</italic> (<bold>c</bold>) and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> (<bold>d</bold>) were measured by Luminex multiplex assays as described in the &#x0201c;Materials and methods&#x0201d; section. All the figures here were prepared via GraphPad software</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41392_2020_269_Fig3_HTML" id="d30e768"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Inflammatory responses to infection were determined via assays to detect multiple cytokines in serum samples. Eight cytokines (G-CSF, IL-1A, IL-8, IL-15, IL-18, MCP-1, MIP-1B, and sCD40-L) were detected in most of the infected animals. Notably, <italic>M. mulatta</italic> HHH-11 and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> SXH-6 showed high expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-1A, IL-8, IL-15, and MCP-1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>). Interestingly, the nasal swabs, anal swabs and fecal samples from these two animals exhibited prolonged viral shedding (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), indicating that these inflammatory cytokines were related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. High levels of IL-15, IL-18, and MCP-1 were observed in <italic>M. mulatta</italic> HHH-3, which showed no antibody induction after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed by flow cytometry. Three major populations of immune cells (T cells, B cells, and monocytes) in red blood cell (RBC)-depleted peripheral blood were measured. Regardless of the age of <italic>M. mulatta</italic> or sex of <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>, the frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and monocytes, but not B cells, peaked at 2 or 4 dpi and then gradually declined (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). The lowest frequencies of these three types of lymphocytes were observed at 10 or 12 dpi, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused transient lymphopenia in <italic>M. mulatta</italic> and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>.</p><p id="Par10">More specifically, to determine the pathological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we necropsied eight animals at the early and late stages of infection according to viral load and chest radiograph. Severe gross lesions were observed mainly on the lungs, spleen and lymph nodes dissected from <italic>M. mulatta</italic> and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> but not <italic>C. jacchus</italic>. The main gross lesions included massive pulmonary punctate hemorrhage, swollen hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and swollen mesenteric lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Histopathological examination showed thickening of the pulmonary septum and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, diffuse hemorrhage and necrosis in the lung. Mild lesions were also observed in the liver, spleen, and kidney (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The detailed histopathological changes were described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. In summary, <italic>M. mulatta</italic> showed pathological changes in all six examined tissues, whereas <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> had four tissues (lung, trachea, bronchus, and kidney) with lesions and <italic>C. jacchus</italic> had pathological changes in three examined tissues (lung, liver, and spleen). Furthermore, typical ultrastructural lesions were observed in the lung (increased numbers of type II pneumocytes, RBCs and macrophages in the alveolar airspace), mesenteric lymph node (intact structure with a large number of lymphocytes, secretory granules in the cytoplasm of cells) and spleen (increased number of granules in the macrophages) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), which was consistent with the results of microscopic inspection. These results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced damage to multiple other tissues in addition to the pulmonary organs.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Pathological evaluation of tissues after SARS-CoV-2 infection. <bold>a</bold> After necropsy, tissue samples were cut to the proper size and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for H&#x00026;E staining, followed by microscopic inspection. Histopathological examination showed thickening of the pulmonary septum and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, diffuse hemorrhage and necrosis in the lungs, and inflammatory infiltration in trachea and bronchus of <italic>M. mulatta</italic>. In the exudate, a small number of lymphocytes and neutrophils were found in some blood vessels of the <italic>M. mulatta</italic> liver, and some hepatocytes were swollen, with multiple vacuole-like cells (mild) and steatosis. The number of germinal centers in the spleen was significantly increased, and capillary hemorrhage occurred in the paracortical area. The renal vesicle space was wider, and some glomeruli had atrophied.

Within 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 was first reported, five kinds of animals were developed into models in which to study COVID-19: the mouse, ferret, tree shrew, golden hamster, and a NHP species. Murine models of COVID-19 were developed by genetic manipulation of human ACE2 through transgene expression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> CRISPR-cas9 editing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and the transient overexpression of ACE2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> which makes mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the many differences in their genetics, anatomy and physiology, these murine models of COVID-19 are not suitable for studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis. The ferret and golden hamster are naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> However, they are also genetically different from humans and are not ideal animal models for studies of vaccines and pathogenesis. The tree shrew is relatively genetically close to primates and can act as an alternative experimental animal to NHPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Unfortunately, our recent study showed that the tree shrew is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may instead be an asymptomatic carrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup></p><p id="Par12">NHPs are widely recognized as ideal animal models for emerging and re-emerging diseases, including SARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and Middle East respiratory syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> To date, there have been four reports of NHP (Old World monkeys) models of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> that recapitulate different aspects of COVID-19, but these models have also raised some debate, probably due to differences in animal species (<italic>M. mulatta</italic> and <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>), virus strain, challenge route, and methods of evaluation. Using comparative analysis, our study revealed that <italic>M. mulatta</italic> is a more susceptible species to SARS-CoV-2 infection than <italic>M. fascicularis</italic> and <italic>C. jacchus</italic>.</p><p id="Par13">Host ACE2 is one of the most important receptors for SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> At the molecular level, amino acid alignment of the ACE2 fragments that interact with the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein revealed the ACE2 fragments from <italic>M. mulatta</italic>, <italic>M. fascicularis</italic>, and humans share the same sequence, while those from <italic>C. jacchus</italic> and humans differ by four amino acids (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). These four amino acids are critically involved in the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Y41 and Q42 in hACE2, which bind the S protein via the formation of hydrogen bonds, are substituted by H and E, respectively, in <italic>C. jacchus</italic> ACE2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> These findings may partially explain the lower susceptibility of <italic>C. jacchus</italic> compared to the other species examined to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sequences of this critical domain in the ACE2 receptors from mouse and ferret differ from that in the hACE2 receptor by eight and seven amino acids, respectively. However, this domain in tree shrew ACE2 differs from that in human ACE2 by ten amino acids. Surprisingly, the golden hamster and human ACE2 receptors differ by only two amino acids. In fact, differences in the number of these amino acids parallel the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="Par14">The NHP model in this study recapitulates several clinical features of COVID-19.

Genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, nasal swabs, feces, and blood/serum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Specifically, nasal swabs had higher levels of viral RNA at the early stage of infection for ~2 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> In the present study, the dynamics of viral shedding in the NHP models were similar to those reported in COVID-19 patients.
