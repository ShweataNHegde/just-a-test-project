Rab18, a small Rab GTPase, regulates intracellular membrane-trafficking events between various compartments in cells and is involved in the life cycle of multiple viruses. However, the effect of Rab18 on the production of CSFV remains uncertain. In this study, we showed that knockdown of Rab18 by lentiviruses inhibited CSFV production, while overexpression of Rab18 by lentiviruses enhanced CSFV production. Subsequent experiments revealed that the negative-mutant Rab18-S22&#x000a0;N inhibited CSFV infection, while the positive-mutant Rab18-Q67&#x000a0;L enhanced CSFV infection. Furthermore, we showed that CSFV RNA replication and virion assembly, measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and confocal microscopy, were reduced in cells lacking Rab18 expression. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation, GST-pulldown, and confocal microscopy assays revealed that Rab18 bound to the viral protein NS5A. Further, NS5A was shown to be redistributed in Rab18 knockdown cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Rab18 as a novel host factor required for CSFV RNA replication and particle assembly by interaction with the viral protein NS5A.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Classical swine fever virus</kwd><kwd>Rab18</kwd><kwd>NS5A</kwd><kwd>interaction</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>assembly</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31772765</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31772765].</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Classical swine fever (CSF), a highly infectious disease caused by classical swine fever virus (CSFV), is one of the diseases notifiable to the Office International Des Epizooties (OIE). CSFV, a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, is an enveloped virus with a 12.3-kb plus-strand RNA genome, carrying one large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTR) [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. The ORF encodes a 3898 amino acid polyprotein precursor, which is cleaved by viral proteases and host proteases into 12 different proteins, including four structural proteins (Core, E<sup>rns</sup>, E1, and E2) and eight non-structural proteins (N<sup>pro</sup>, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>].</p><p>The CSFV NS5A protein is a 55-kDa protein containing 497 amino acids and primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host cell [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. Similar to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), other members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, the CSFV NS5A protein is also a zinc metalloprotein [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Together with other non-structural proteins (i.e., NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5B), it forms an RNA replicase complex, which is involved in viral RNA replication [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. The conserved sequence C2717-C2740-C2742-C2767 of NS5A is essential for viral replication [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Additionally, another conserved sequence in the C-terminal region (amino acids 478&#x02013;487) of NS5A protein is required for virion assembly [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. Although the definitive mechanism of the NS5A protein in the CSFV life cycle and pathogenesis remains unknown, its mechanism in modulating the host cell environment has been confirmed. Studies proved that the interactions between host cell proteins and NS5A were essential for infectious virus production. Previous studies showed that the NS5A protein interacts with the 3&#x002b9;-UTR, 5&#x002b9;-UTR, and NS5B protein [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Moreover, the host proteins ANXA2, HSP70, and Rab1A (identified as NS5A binding proteins) enhance CSFV production [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>].</p><p>Rab GTPases are a superfamily of small GTPases, which contains approximately 70 Rab proteins in eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Rab proteins are known as regulators of vesicular transport in the cycling between a GDP-bound inactive form and GTP-bound active form [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. Rab18, belonging to the Rab GTPases family, is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and lipid droplets (LDs), and plays a central role in vesicular transport from the Golgi to the ER [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. In Warburg Micro Syndrome, Rab18 is a critical regulator of neuronal migration and morphogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. In addition, Rab18 promotes the growth and chemoresistance of gastric cancer by regulating mitochondrial function [<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. Previous studies showed that Rab18 was involved in the proliferation of numerous viruses. Rab18 is essential for HCV assembly through trafficking of the viral protein core and NS5A to LDs [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. Rab18 is also an important host factor for BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) and dengue virus (DENV) infection [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. Recently, Rab1, Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11 were identified as essential host factors for CSFV invasion and replication [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. However, the function of Rab18 in the CSFV life cycle has not been illustrated.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated the positive role of Rab18 in CSFV infection using Rab18 knockdown and Rab18 overexpression cell lines as well as Rab18(Q67L)- and Rab18(S22N)-transfected cells. Our results demonstrated Rab18 as an essential host factor for CSFV production in multiple life cycles, including viral replication and particle assembly, through binding of the viral protein NS5A. Further, we characterized Rab18 as a novel factor in the host-virus protein molecular interaction network of CSFV replication, which may represent a potential antiviral strategy for anti-CSFV treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>The swine umbilical vein endothelial cell lines (SUVECs) conserved in our laboratory were cultured in Medium 199 (Gibco, Cat 11150059) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Cat 10099141&#x000a0;C), 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat 375095), and penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat V900929) [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>].

Rab proteins, typically serving as molecular switches to mediate vesicular transport between membrane organelles, have been shown to be required for production of certain viruses [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. Rab18 has been shown to be involved in the endocytic system, secretory pathway, and cell autophagy [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. In a recent study, Rab18 was found to enhance HCV, BK polyomavirus, and DENV replication [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. However, its functional involvement in CSFV infection has not been clearly defined. In this study, Rab18 knockdown and overexpression cell lines were generated by recombinant lentivirus to demonstrate the potential role of Rab18 in CSFV infection. Our results showed that CSFV replication was inhibited in Rab18-S22N-transfected cells and Rab18-silenced cell lines but enhanced in Rab18-Q67L-transfected cells and Rab18 overexpression cell lines, indicating the positive role of Rab18 in CSFV infection. Indeed, our previous studies have confirmed that Golgi-ER trafficking regulators of Rab1A and Rab2 were required for CSFV infection and suggested that trafficking of vesicles between the Golgi apparatus and the ER was important for CSFV production [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. These results also suggested that vesicular transport mediated by Rab18 might play an important role in the CSFV life cycle. Therefore, besides Rab1A, Rab2, Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11, Rab18 is considered a novel Rab protein essential for CSFV infection.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, viruses can rearrange in different intracellular membrane organelles to promote self-production [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable for viruses to utilize Rab proteins that are located in different membrane organelles for replication. During viral invasion, an enveloped virus enters Rab5-positive early endosomes and Rab7-positive late endosomes successively, and some viruses are then absorbed into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. Rab proteins are also required during the late period of viral replication, including virus assembly and release. Rab1, which regulates vesicular transport from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, is required for HCV release [<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. Rab7 activity upregulation in HBV-infected cells promoted virus release, probably by reducing viral trafficking to endosomal, lysosomal, and autophagic secretion systems [<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>]. Some viruses often utilize the same Rab proteins in different steps of their life cycle. For example, Rab7 was required for HIV particle maturation and secretion [<xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>]. Rab18 is known as a regulator of endosomal transport and retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport in eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>]. To further explore which step of CSFV infection is Rab18-dependent, we systematically dissected the role of Rab18 in the CSFV life cycle. Our results showed that Rab18 did not influence CSFV binding and entry in SUVECs, indicating that Rab18 was not essential during the endocytosis process of CSFV invasion in SUVECs. However, in previous studies, Rab18 has been shown to be involved in the endocytosis process [<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>], yet no direct evidence has shown that virus invasion is affected by Rab18. Like HCV and BVDV, other members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, CSFV enters cells occurs through endosome-dependent invasion pathways [<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>]. CSFV enters PAM cells through caveolae-mediated endocytosis-early endosome (Rab5)-late endosome (Rab7)-recycling endosome pathways [<xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>]. Moreover, CSFV entry into PK-15 cells occurs by clathrin-mediated endocytosis-early endosome (Rab5)-late endosome (Rab7) pathways [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. Hence, further detailed studies are needed to elucidate the function of Rab18 in CSFV entry in other cell lines.</p><p>Based on our previous results, we chose four time points (1, 3, 5, and 7&#x000a0;h) to explore the role of Rab18 in CSFV RNA replication. Our results showed that CSFV genome copies were decreased in Rab18-silenced cell lines at different time points, compared with NTshRNA cell lines. Our results also showed co-localization of CSFV dsRNA and Rab18 in CSFV-infected cells by confocal microscopy. Consistent with previous studies, HCV RNA replication was inhibited in Rab18 knockdown cells, indicating the essential role of Rab18 in viral RNA replication [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. These findings suggested that Rab18 might act as a host factor on the CSFV replication complex to enhance genome replication. Additionally, Rab27a is located in HCV RNA replication complexes to promote viral RNA replication in HCV-infected cells [<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. Intracellular detection of mature virus was not observed by TCID50 assay at 1 and 3&#x000a0;h post-infection. Therefore, viral titers of intracellular CSFV were quantified by TCID50 assay at 5 and 7&#x000a0;h post-infection, and the relative intracellular specific infectivity was calculated as a ratio of the intracellular viral infectivity to the intracellular CSFV RNA. Consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>], we showed that the intracellular specific infectivity was decreased in shRab18 cells compared to NTshRNA cells, indicating that Rab18 was required for virion assembly.</p><p>Accumulating studies have indicated that the interactions between cell proteins and NS5A are essential to CSFV RNA replication and virion assembly [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Rab proteins serve as molecular switches, cycling between the inactive GDP-bound form and active GTP-bound form. GTP-bound-Rab proteins were mainly located in membranes, while GDP-bound-Rab proteins were located in the cytosol [<xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref>]. C-terminal cysteine residues of GDP-bound Rab proteins are prenylated by geranylgeranyl transferase [<xref rid="CIT0048">48</xref>]. After prenylation, Rab proteins are able to relocate to a special membrane, where GEFs (guanine-nucleotide exchange factors) interact with Rab proteins and exchange the bound GDP for GTP. Further, GTP-bound Rab proteins interact with effectors to mediate vesicular transport [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]. Once on the target membrane, GTP-bound Rab proteins are hydrolyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) to GDP-bound Rab proteins, then GDP-bound Rab proteins are released from the membrane to the cytosol by GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref>]. Previous studies have confirmed that the interaction between Rab18 and NS5A can promote HCV assembly [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. Further, our results revealed direct binding of NS5A and Rab18 by Co-IP and GST-pulldown assays, indicating that the interaction between NS5A and Rab18 may mediate the virus RNA replication and assembly. Because GTP-bound Rab proteins were located in the membranes, while GDP-bound Rab proteins were mostly located in the cytoplasm, we examined the interaction between NS5A and different forms of Rab18. Our results revealed that NS5A bound to the inactive form of GDP-Rab18(S22N) and active form GTP-Rab18(Q67L), indicating that Rab18 may serve as a carrier to regulate NS5A location in CSFV-infected cells.</p><p>Anterograde and retrograde trafficking of vesicles between the Golgi apparatus and the ER are regulated by Rab proteins [<xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>], including Golgi-located protein Rab18 [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. As shown in our study, Rab18, Rab18 (S22N), and Rab18 (Q67L) were mainly located in the Golgi apparatus in both cells and CSFV-infected cells, which is consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. Considering that Rab18 has the function of regulating vesicle trafficking between Golgi and ER, and Rab18 was found to enhance HCV infection through trafficking of C and NS5A protein to assembly sites [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>], we tested the distribution of NS5A in Rab18 knockdown cell lines. Our results showed that the distribution of NS5A was changed from aggregate distribution in NTshRNA cells to punctate distribution in Rab18-silenced cells, which was also observed in GDP-Rab18(S22N)-transfected cells, indicating that Rab18 can modulate the distribution of CSFV NS5A protein.</p><p>Because CSFV RNA copies and virion assembly were decreased in Rab18 knockdown cells, the role of Rab18 in virus secretion cannot be clearly defined. However, reduction of relative intracellular and extracellular specific infectivities in shRNA18 cells may indicate a role of Rab18 in virus secretion (data not shown). In conclusion, our results revealed Rab18 as a novel host factor, which is required for CSFV production and plays an essential role in the virus RNA replication and assembly steps of CSFV infection.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Y.M.Z., L.Z., and K.K.G. designed the experiments.
