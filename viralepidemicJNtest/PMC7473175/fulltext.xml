This study aimed at investigating the genomic variation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Taiwan and compared their evolutionary trajectories with the global strains. We performed culture and full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains followed by phylogenetic analysis. A 382-nucleotides deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was found in a Taiwanese strain isolated from a patient on February 4, 2020 who had a travel history to Wuhan. Patients in the first wave also included several sporadic, local transmission cases. Genomes of 5 strains sequenced from clustered infections were classified into a new clade with ORF1ab-V378I mutation, in addition to 3 dominant clades ORF8-L84S, ORF3a-G251V and S-D614G. This highlighted clade also included some strains isolated from patients who had a travel history to Turkey and Iran. The second wave mostly resulted from patients who had a travel history to Europe and Americas. All Taiwanese viruses were classified into various clades. Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan revealed a new ORF8-deletion mutant and a virus clade that may be associated with infections in the Middle East, which contributed to a better understanding of the global SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>Phylogeny</kwd><kwd>ORF8 deletion</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="37"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are classified into four genera, including <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Prior to 2019, six CoVs were known to infect human, including human CoV 229E and NL63 belonging to the genera <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, and human CoV OC43, HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related CoV (SARSr-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) belonging to the genera <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref>]. The seventh and novel coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province in China, in December 2019 [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This virus belongs to the genera <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> and has been designated as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease is named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The World Health Organization declared this disease a pandemic on March 11, 2020.</p><p>As of April 14, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 1,844,863 confirmed cases and 117,021 deaths worldwide [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], among which 393 confirmed cases and 6 deaths were reported in Taiwan [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With rapidly increasing number of infections, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] provides a platform for sharing SARS-CoV-2 sequences and their metadata. Three major clades, including clade G (with G variant at position 614 within the spike protein, as S-D614G), clade S (ORF8-L84S), and clade V (ORF3a-G251V), were designated by the GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/hcov-19-analysis-update/">https://www.gisaid.org/hcov-19-analysis-update/</ext-link>). However, the imbalance of genome information contributed to this platform could prevent us from comprehensively understand the viral transmission and epidemiology of this pandemic. In particular that none or very few sequences have been reported from some countries. With more virus genomes become available, we would be able to better address the diversification and evolution of this virus.</p><p>There have been two waves of COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. The first occurred from late January to the end of February, with most infections originating from China either by Chinese tourists or Taiwanese businessmen returning to Taiwan from China for celebrating Chinese New Year. The second and bigger wave started in early March, during which the infections were largely caused by Taiwanese tourists, business travellers, or students returning from other countries. Although most of these cases were traced to their foreign origins, some small and clustered infections were suspected to have been resulted from local transmission.</p><p>In this study, we performed culture and full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and further investigated the viral genome polymorphism within individual human clinical specimens through their metagenomic data. We compared the genomes of Taiwanese strains to those of global strains to describe their genetic variations and evolutionary trajectory. Strikingly, an open reading frame 8 (ORF8) deletion was found in one Taiwanese strain. Moreover, a highlighted clade with ORF1ab-V378I mutation was observed in addition to the three major clades designated by the GISAID. Interestingly, included in this clade were some strains isolated from patients with travel history to Turkey and Iran, where few viral genomes have yet been reported in the Middle East region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials methods" id="S002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="ethics-statement" id="S002-S2001"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Medical Foundation, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan (approval no. 202000468B0B1).</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2002"><title>Specimen collection</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to the guidelines of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En">https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En</ext-link>) [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

To isolate the virus, all procedures were performed in accordance with the laboratory biosafety guidelines of the Taiwan CDC in a biosafety level-3 facility. Cells grown to 80&#x02013;90% confluency in standard screw-up culture tubes (16&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;125&#x02005;mm) were inoculated with 500&#x02005;&#x003bc;L of the virus solution. The virus solution was prepared by diluting 100 &#x003bc;L of the specimen samples with 1.5&#x02005;mL of sample pretreatment medium consisting of MEM, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 2x penicillin-streptomycin solution, followed by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02005;h. Virus absorption process was allowed at 37&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02005;h, after which 2&#x02005;mL of the virus culture medium composed of MEM, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin solution was added, and the culture mixture was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C. Infected cells were observed daily to determine the cytopathic effect of the virus on the cells. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis using the RNA extracted from part of the culture supernatant every 2 days after inoculation was performed to monitor viral growth. We continuously observed the infected cells until the cytopathic effect was noticed in more than 75% of the cells, after which the culture supernatant was harvested and stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C. Viral titer was determined by Vero-E6 cells with medium consisting of DMEM, 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.4% agarose, followed by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 3 days.</p></sec><sec id="S002-S2004"><title>Whole-Genome sequencing</title><p>Twenty samples (CGMH-CGU No. 1&#x02013;20) were collected (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). RNA was extracted either from the culture supernatant or directly from the specimens using a QIAmp viral RNA mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, except that the carrier RNA was replaced with linear acrylamide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as the co-precipitant. The amount of viral RNA was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR to examine the Ct value of the viral E gene (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For RNAs showing a high Ct value, we used the Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (Nugen Technologies, San Carlos, CA, USA) to synthesize cDNA that was further processed into a library using the Celero DNA-Seq System (Nugen Technologies). Other samples with lower Ct values were used for library preparation by using the Trio RNA-Seq kit (Nugen Technologies). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on an Illumina MiSeq System (San Diego, CA, USA) with paired-end reads. More than 0.75 and 2.5 Gb of raw data per sample were generated from viral isolates and clinical specimens, respectively.

Four nucleotide substitutions were found in this strain when compared to the genome of the Wuhan-1 strain. Two were located at the ORF1ab position 8517 changing from C to T (as C8517T) and position 16577 from A to G (A16577G). The latter was a non-synonymous mutation resulting in an amino acid change at position 5526 from K to R (K5526R). The other two mutations in CGMH-CGU-02 were also non-synonymous, located in the S gene at C145T (H49Y) and C2651T (S884F).

CGMH-CGU-09 was isolated from a patient who had a travel history to Germany, and has been clustered with other European strains.

Five Australian strains (NSW05, NSW06, NSW11, NSW12, and NSW13) [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and one German strain (BavPat2, according to the metadata from the GISAID) from patients having a travel history to Iran were also grouped in this clade.

All the other viruses in this clade were also dated after February 26. This long time gap in the identification of the two Chinese strains isolated in mid-January suggests that it is unlikely that the later strains were directly linked to the Wuhan strains.

CGMH-CGU-03, -05, and -06 genomes were identical and served as the baseline for assessing pairwise genetic distances to the other two cluster members. CGMH-CGU-04 was found to have 3 ORF1ab nucleotide substitutions (A4788G, C10809T, and G21055A); the third position was a non-synonymous change with a G7019S amino acid substitution (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D).

Currently, there are abundant viral genomic data from Asia, Europe, and America but very few from the Middle East. Our findings may contribute to developing a better understanding of the global SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics.</p><p>We detected a 382-nt deletion covering nearly the entire ORF8 of the genome of the CGMH-CGU-02 isolate obtained from a patient who returned from Wuhan in February 2020. A similar observation was found in Singapore strains [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These observations suggest the possible circulation of this strain in Wuhan in the first few months of the outbreak, as well as transmission to other geographical regions. Deletions in ORF8 were also observed during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, which were associated with a reduced ability for virus replication in human cells [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 strains with this ORF8 deletion are believed to be still evolving and might have different evolutionary paths compared with those having no such deletion.</p><p>Despite the overall high sequence similarity, different clusters of SARS-CoV-2 strains identified in several countries can be distinguished based on phylogenetic analysis, and each cluster has been characterized by its conserved and unique mutations (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). It is not unusual to have viral mutations during an outbreak, especially for RNA viruses, but mutations that might affect virulence or pathogenicity are of concern. The second-wave strains circulating in Taiwan (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E) are characterized by Asp to Gly mutation at position 614 of the S gene that encodes the spike protein required for viral entrance. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is divided into S1 and S2 subunits that function in receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Biochemical and structural studies have indicated several unique residues of SARS-CoV-2 that greatly improve the receptor-binding activity [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref>]. In addition, a four amino acid, Pro-Arg-Arg-Ala, inserted immediately upstream of the S1/S2 cleavage site generates a polybasic cleavage site of ubiquitous furin-like proteases that might affect the tissue tropism and/or transmissibility [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lau et al. further used a Vero-E6 culture system to detect an attenuated variant with S1/S2 junction deletions [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Whether the receptor-binding activity or furin cleavage might be altered by D614G mutation remains to be investigated. Moreover, its nearby region contains several glycosylations as determined from the glycosylation shield structures [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Whether the mutation might change the glycosylation status and eventually change antigenicity awaits further analysis.</p><p>RNA viruses show variations in their genomes due to nucleotide substitutions generated by the low fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during replication. Such genomic variations are believed to facilitate the successful adaption of the virus to various hosts. Previous studies show that the mutation rates of RNA viruses vary in different viruses and depend on the viral transmission modes [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from 5 clustered infections between February 26 to March 9, 2020 in Taiwan revealed only 4 mutations in their 29,903-nt genomic RNA, suggesting that the nucleotide substitution rate was limited during viral RNA replication. The nsp14 exoribonuclease encoded by several coronaviruses plays a crucial role in proofreading during genome replication [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Investigation of the function of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 and its replication fidelity is required to be undertaken in the future.</p><p>Metagenomic sequencing can help in rapidly exploring the genomic content of targeted viruses in a sample. It also helps in detecting any other pathogens in the microenvironment. <italic>Haemophili</italic> are common and representative bacterial species found in the upper respiratory tract samples of patients, and play an important role between the host and the environment [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Molyneaux et al. and Hofstra el al. found a significant outgrowth of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> from the pre-existing upper respiratory tract after a rhinovirus infection in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and healthy volunteers, respectively [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Kosikowska et al. further demonstrated that <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> could be a marker of microbiota changes in the upper respiratory tract caused by antibiotics [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Ou et al. recently detected <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> and <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> from sputum samples collected from a severe COVID-19 case [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although the prevalence and clinical impact of <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> in SARS-CoV-2-positive cases remain unclear, we demonstrated the advantage and capacity of metagenomic NGS in identifying co-existence with <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic>. It suggested that further NGS studies are required to determine the respiratory microbiota composition and detect the co-infection/existence with other respiratory pathogens, providing new insights to the association between the virus with other pathogens.</p><p>In summary, two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic were documented in Taiwan. The first wave mostly included patients who had returned from China and the second one mostly included those who had travelled to Europe and Americas. We found a 382-nucleotide deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) in one isolate in the first wave, as well as 5 clustered cases failed to trace to any imported ones and were hence considered sporadic local transmission cases. Moreover, these 5 genomes were phylogenetically designated to a clade harbouring the ORF1ab-V378I mutation, which is different from the 3 previously reported clades ORF8-L84S, ORF3a-G251V and S-D614G. Also included in this clade were some strains obtained from patients who had a travel history to Turkey and Iran. Highlighting this clade may provide important viral genome information regarding the COVID-19 outbreaks in the Middle East.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM4509"><caption><title>Supplemental_Figure_S2-1_final.jpg</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_1782271_SM4509.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM4508"><caption><title>Supplemental_Figure_S1-1_final.jpg</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_1782271_SM4508.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="S005"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Lefkowitz</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Dempsey</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Hendrickson</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name>, <etal>et al.</etal></person-group>
