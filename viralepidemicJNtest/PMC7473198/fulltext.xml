No effective vaccine is currently available to prevent COVID-19, and intense efforts are being invested worldwide into vaccine development. In this context, all technology platforms must overcome several challenges resulting from the use of an incompletely characterized new virus. These include finding the right conditions for virus amplification for the development of vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles. Here, we describe a shotgun tandem mass spectrometry workflow, the data produced can be used to guide optimization of the conditions for viral amplification. In parallel, we analysed the changes occurring in the host cell proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection to glean information on the biological processes modulated by the virus that could be further explored as potential drug targets to deal with the pandemic.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>host response</kwd><kwd>infection kinetics</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>viral protein detection</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Closely related to the SARS-CoV virus, SARS-CoV-2 is a B lineage beta-coronavirus [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is the causative agent of COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory syndrome that spread worldwide within a few weeks following its initial emergence in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The four major structural genes encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), an envelope protein (E) and the membrane glycoprotein (M); an additional membrane glycoprotein (HE) is present in the HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 beta-coronavirus genus [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Based on the speed at which the outbreak of COVID-19 developed, SARS-CoV-2 spreads easily among human populations. The reproductive number (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) for the uncontained virus is currently thought to be around 3, suggesting a potential for sustained human-to-human transmission that appears to occur through exchange of respiratory droplets, and possibly a faecal-oral route [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this pandemic situation, one of the outstanding questions relates to how we can contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its persistence in the human population. Social distancing policies, lockdown, and other containment measures have been implemented worldwide to slow the spread of the pandemic. Current roadmaps to lifting these restrictions hinge on the deployment of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and ultimately on the development of an effective vaccine.</p><p>Several platforms are being used to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, approaches include attempts to produce spike subunit, DNA, RNA, whole-virion, and nanoparticle vaccines [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most successful vaccines use inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles as vaccine antigen to induce neutralizing antibodies against viral structural proteins [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>]. However, virus yields from the dedicated cell culture systems may be relatively low compared to the quantities expected to be required for massive vaccine production. In addition, virus production campaigns are time-consuming and highly demanding due to the danger of working with these pathogens. As a result, optimization of the production of whole viral particle antigens is of great interest in the search for effective vaccines. Alongside vaccine development, a better understanding of how the host responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help direct further therapeutic avenues.</p><p>Multiple proteomics strategies have improved our understanding of the structures of coronaviruses and the molecular mechanisms they exploit for infection. Tracheal tissues from chickens infected with infectious bronchitis coronavirus were analysed by 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry to establish the host response [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Vero cells infected with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) were analysed by shotgun proteomics [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several PEDV coronavirus strains were compared using a quantitative approach, i.e. iTRAQ-labelling [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The results revealed differences in elicitation of the inflammatory cascade. The dynamics of the host proteins affected by specific overexpressed coronavirus genes was also established [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although no study has yet been published on the proteomics characterization of SARS-CoV-2 virus, several manuscripts of interest were recently submitted and should soon become available [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe a workflow based on shotgun tandem mass spectrometry data that, in addition to gaining more basic information about SARS-CoV-2 infection, aims to guide the optimization of the conditions for whole viral particle antigen production and aid SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials methods" id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Cell culture and virus preparation</title><p>Vero E6 (ATCC, CLR-1586) cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C under 9% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco&#x02122;, ThermoFisher) supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.5% penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin.

As the significant biological characteristics of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in tissues are currently unclear, a delayed time-point of 7 days post-infection was included to understand the relationship between virus replication and cell damage, which appeared quite mild at early time-points. Overall, 3220 Vero cell proteins and 6 SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified by 27,388 and 94 unique peptides (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1%), respectively (Table S1). Among the viral proteins, three (N, S, M) of the four structural proteins, and three of the sixteen non-structural proteins were identified. The non-structural proteins were peptides corresponding to the ORF1a papain-like protease (PLpro) / 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the accessory proteins encoded by ORF3a and ORF7a. These protein sequences were covered by 40 (N), 29 (S), 7 (M), 13 (ORF1ab), 4 (ORF3a), and 1 (ORF7a) distinct peptides. Sequence coverage for polypeptides depends on their abundance, size, and the occurrence of lysine and arginine residues. The ORF7a protein, with just 121 residues, was thus logically not as well detected as the others. Based on the sets of peptides shared by the individual proteins, 2984 protein groups were identified, for which a total of 457,111 PSMs were assigned. Viral proteins represented 1.4% of these PSMs.

Viral amplification was slightly delayed in cells infected at MOI 0.001 (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). SARS-CoV-2 N, S, and M were consistently among the most abundant proteins detected. Their respective ratios were relatively constant over time. The decline in abundance of viral proteins registered at 7 days post-infection was in accordance with notable cytopathic effect following intense virus replication, observed here for all cultures at this time-point, as previously reported [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Dimension reduction by PCA showed that early and late time-points were distinctively distributed along principal components 1 and 2, with replicates clustering closely. The same pattern was observed for both MOI. Interestingly, a degree of overlap was observed for time-points J3 and J4, corresponding to the peak of viral protein abundance, suggesting a smaller evolution of the host proteome between these time-points (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Addition of the viral proteins measured at each time-point did not affect sample separation. To elucidate the host response during virus amplification, we performed a co-expression cluster analysis to determine host proteins showing similar profiles over time (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Functional enrichment analysis performed on the members of each cluster provided an overview of the biological processes affected by the virus (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A-C). At MOI 0.01, clusters 2 and 5, with 345 and 198 protein members respectively, had very similar statistically enriched terms, with functions and pathways related to the viral life cycle among the most frequently represented. Functional interaction network analysis showed cluster-specific enrichment of functions like membrane trafficking and protein pre-processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, to be highly interconnected with regulation of mRNA processing/splicing via spliceosome (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A-B). In addition, enriched biological functions overlapped for clusters 3 and 6, with 16 and 10 representatives, respectively, characterized by a specific increase in the abundance of clustered proteins at 3 days post-infection. Proteins involved in cornification and ECM (Extra Cellular Matrix) regulators were among the top 20 significantly enriched terms (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). Four distinct expression profiles were identified at MOI 0.001 (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Comparative analysis and inference of enriched biological pathways revealed significant enrichment of functions related to host responses to viral replication in clusters 2 and 3. Thus, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (R-HSA-8856828) and vesicle-mediated transport (R-HSA-5653656) pathways were specific to cluster 2 (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D); these pathways are likely to be involved in vacuole formation and viral budding. Interestingly, similar to cluster 2 identified at higher MOI, the expression profiles of the members of these clusters reflect the dynamics of viral protein levels across the kinetics. Clusters 4 (MOI 0.01) and 3 (MOI 0.001) were enriched in pathways and biological functions related to the host cell&#x02019;s central metabolism, with RNA metabolism and translation among the most highly enriched pathways. Although the temporal expression profiles of the proteins in these clusters show no major changes, we cannot exclude that they are remodelled by the virus, or that their abundance is drastically altered at earlier time-points (&#x0003c;24&#x02005;h).

In this context, in the search for vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles, the identification of the right conditions for virus amplification could be challenging. Virus yields from dedicated cell culture systems could also represent a limitation. Alongside vaccine development, inactivated virus particles are also of interest when testing real serology or screening neutralizing antibodies. Naturally, production of well-characterized active virus particles is also of interest for basic research purposes. Given the requirement for speed, for this study we evaluated the use of LC-MS/MS as a tool to guide condition optimization for SARS-CoV-2 whole viral particle antigen production.</p><p>The results presented here demonstrate the potential of our pipeline to profile virus production over time. In particular, by analysing the proteome of Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at two different MOI, it was possible to monitor changes in the levels of three SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and three non-structural ones. As for other analyses [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], peptides from protein E-like were undetectable. The lack of evidence for other accessory proteins could be put down to differences in sample processing, with the protocol described here favouring simplified steps and speed, while maintaining accuracy. More extensive analyses are planned to monitor virus homogeneity during viral production once the most permissive conditions have been established.</p><p>Protein profiles were remarkably comparable at the two MOI tested, with the profiles obtained at the lower MOI slightly delayed and hence more insightful regarding the timing of the viral burst.</p><p>Overrepresented proteins were identified by a larger variety of peptides. Interestingly, an increase in protein levels was reflected by the increasing abundance of the same set of peptides, with only a few new sequences registered at late time-points. This observation suggests that targeted absolute quantification of the virus could be used to monitor peptides that are detectable early. Tandem mass spectrometry proteotyping [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] could also ultimately be proposed to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral activity.</p><p>In addition to profiling virus production, our mass spectrometry analysis of the whole cell content provides insights into the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although more detailed information is available regarding how the virus enters the cell, increased information on the subsequent steps in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle are needed [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We are not aware of other attempts to characterize the cellular response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. These cells mount a weak innate response to viruses, making them extraordinarily competent for propagating several virus types to high titres [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, this specificity means that similar proteomics data should be acquired for multiple cell lines from humans and primates, using comparative proteomics to define the shared mechanisms of cell infection and those that are specific to a given cell line. This approach will allow us, ultimately, to grasp all the essential aspects of the host cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>The analysis of our proteomics data suggested substantial temporal remodelling of the host proteome over the time-points analysed. Functional enrichment analysis of clusters of proteins showing similar expression profiles highlighted key pathways during virus replication. The result provides potential targets for effective therapies against coronaviruses. In corroboration of the pathways identified by Bojkova et al. [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] using the human colon epithelial carcinoma cell line Caco-2 to analyse SARS-CoV-2 replication, we identified clusters of proteins increased by infection that were particularly enriched in RNA modifiers, such as spliceosome components, and proteins involved in carbon metabolism, further supporting the preliminary evidence that splicing is an essential pathway for SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus a potential therapeutic target. Additional clusters of proteins identified in our analysis highlighted the regulation of pathways critical for the virus life cycle, such as those involved in protein pre-processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole formation and viral budding. Interestingly, proteins participating in viral RNA replication and translation or involved in various functions including cytoskeleton dynamics, metabolic enzymes, and signal transduction were described in 2005 by Jiang and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] as differentially regulated after SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells.</p><p>Here, we show that our pipeline based on LC-MS/MS analysis is suitable for the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 production. We therefore suggest that when optimizing the conditions for viral amplification, it could be relevant to speed up the initial steps in favour of later stages during the development process, which will require a more careful assessment of effectiveness and safety.</p><p>In addition, the peptide information presented here provides sufficient information to design targeted analyses [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], opening the possibility of using targeted mass spectrometry-based approaches to assess critical aspects (<italic>i.e.</italic> quality and quantity) during virus purification processes. Furthermore, the changes characterized in cellular protein networks following SARS-CoV-2 infection provided valuable avenues for further exploration and could guide the identification of drug targets to address the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>We anticipate that the same workflow could be successfully applied to expedite the characterization of human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices used to obtain insights into the successive steps in the virus&#x02019; life cycle, as well as to study human disease pathogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in response to infection by variants of SARS-Cov-2 and following the application of existing [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref>] and novel therapies.</p></sec><sec id="S005"><title>Author contributions</title><p>LG, FG, OP, LB, and JA conceptualized the study design; FG, JCG, HB, SR, and NB performed the experiments; LG, OP, DG, FG, LB and JA analysed the data; GM, KC, SD, MAR, GS, CF, AD, BAB, and CA contributed reagents and to software development; LG and JA drafted the manuscript.
