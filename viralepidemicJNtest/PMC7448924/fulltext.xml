Using a &#x0201c;plug-and-display&#x0201d; SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, we coupled RBD to lumazine synthase (LS) particles producing multimeric RBD-presenting particles (RBD-LS). RBD-LS vaccination induced antibody responses of high magnitude and quality (avidity, MERS-CoV neutralizing capacity, and mucosal immunity) with cross-clade neutralization. The antibody responses were associated with blocking viral replication and upper and lower respiratory tract protection against MERS-CoV infection in rabbits. This arrayed multivalent presentation of the viral RBD using the antigen-SpyTag/LS-SpyCatcher is a promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidate and this platform may be applied for the rapid development of vaccines against other emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>MERS-coronavirus</kwd><kwd>spike</kwd><kwd>i301</kwd><kwd>lumazine synthase</kwd><kwd>spytag-spycatcher</kwd><kwd>rabbit</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Emerging zoonotic viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been able to cross the species barrier posing a threat to the human population. MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory disease and fatalities in humans [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the virus is continuously introduced into the human population through infected dromedary camels, the viral reservoir with resulting outbreaks [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The wide geographical distribution of this viral reservoir, the high case-fatality rate in humans (35%), and the lack of treatment and licensed vaccines, make the virus a threat to the human population. This has put MERS-CoV on the recent WHO list of diseases having an epidemic or even pandemic potential for which countermeasures are lacking and are urgently needed [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Vaccination is potentially one of the most effective ways to prevent the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreaks. Several MERS-CoV vaccine candidates have been developed using different platforms including inactivated, live-attenuated, and subunit vaccines [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Compared to other vaccine production platforms, recombinant subunit proteins have a higher safety profile, are relatively faster and easier to produce, and can be scaled-up in a more cost-effective manner; nonetheless, they tend to induce lower levels of protective immunity [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The use of self-assembling multimeric protein scaffold particles (MPSP) to present antigens in a multivalent virus-mimicking manner (size, repetitiveness, and geometry), has been shown to enhance vaccine-induced immune responses [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;11</xref>], and to offer advantages over other multimeric antigen presentation platforms (reviewed in [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Both lumazine synthase (LS) and I3-01 (I3) can self-assemble into 60-meric particles, which can be expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and have been used as scaffolds for development of multimeric vaccines with improved immune responses compared to monomeric forms [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>]. An LS-based HIV vaccine, (eOD-GT8), has recently advanced to a phase I human clinical trial (NCT03547245). Linking of antigens to these MPSP can be achieved through several mechanisms; as e.g. genetic fusion or the SypTag-SpyCatcher (ST/SC) system [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the former requires the antigen and scaffold to be produced in the same expression system, the latter allows each to be expressed in its suitable system harnessing a rapid post-translational &#x0201c;plug-and-play&#x0201d; assembly. This is advantageous, allowing scaffold-SC to be produced at scalable levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> and SpyTagged glycosylated antigens such as viral surface proteins to be produced in its optimal system, such as mammalian or insect cells. The antigen-ST can then be multivalently displayed on the surface of the SC-scaffolds through the spontaneous formation of a stable isopeptide bond. This can be a platform for rapid vaccine manufacturing in case of epidemics or pandemics, to create optimized vaccines at reduced costs and also with reduced development times.</p><p>The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is the main target for subunit vaccine development [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It assembles as a homotrimer and consists of an N-terminal head (S1 subunit) and a C-terminal stalk (S2 subunit). The S1 subunit mediates virus attachment and entry through its N-terminal S1<sup>A</sup> domain and its C-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD), respectively [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The S1<sup>A</sup> domain binds sialic acids, a viral attachment factor, while the RBD binds to the viral receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Following attachment and entry, the S2 subunit mediates viral fusion to the host cell through its fusion machinery; comprised of the fusion peptide (FP) and the two heptad repeats &#x02013; HR1 and HR2 [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (Abs) mainly recognize epitopes in the RBD of the spike head S1 subunit; and to a lower extent, epitopes in the sialic acid binding domain and the fusion-mediating more conserved S stalk (S2). Nonetheless, antibodies directed against the sialic acid binding S1<sup>A</sup> domain or the more conserved S2 subunit, although subdominant, may protect against MERS-CoV [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Immune focusing can enhance immune responses to subdominant regions [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the current study, using LS and I3 self-assembling particles, we evaluated whether immune focusing and multivalent presentation can induce immune responses to the more sequence-conserved S2 regions: FP and HR2. Furthermore, using a SypTag/SpyCatcher system and LS particles, we tested whether immune focusing with/without multivalent presentation of the viral RBD can lead to enhanced protection against a MERS-CoV challenge in rabbits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials methods" id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Protein design and expression</title><p>Expression constructs were cloned using standard PCR methods.

Despite producing strong antibody responses, the monomeric RBD failed to protect rabbits against MERS-CoV following an intranasal challenge. The presence of LS did not seem to influence the outcome, as it was included in the formulation of the monomeric form (RBD&#x02009;+&#x02009;LS), indicating that the coupling and the multimeric presentation are responsible for the enhanced response seen with the multimeric RBD-LS vaccine. The &#x0201c;plug-and-display&#x0201d; SpyTag/SpyCatcher system [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] used to generate these multimeric RBD-LS particles allows for rapid and robust production of vaccines in a cost-effective manner. This enables the development of vaccines in a timely manner, which is crucial to prevent global public health consequences of evolving, emerging and re-emerging viruses.</p><p>The efficacy of RBD-LS immunization in protecting against a MERS-CoV challenge, makes it a potential vaccine candidate for further development. Nonetheless, in case of production at an industrial scale, unnecessary sequences (e.g. tags) need to be removed, preparations have to be further structurally and biochemically characterized.</p><p>When using scaffolds as antigen carriers, anti-scaffold antibody responses need to be considered to avoid their potential to compromise the targeted antigen-induced responses or to induce potential auto-antibodies against human antigens. Antibody responses were induced against the LS protein scaffold used in this study. However, antigen-specific responses were boosted following the second immunization and were not adversely affected by the presence of these anti-scaffold antibodies (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), similar to other reports [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Since the sequence of the LS protein does not show any similarity to any human sequences, it is unlikely that they will induce unwanted auto- (antihuman) antibodies. An LS-based vaccine for HIV, in a current phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03547245), can provide further evidence for the safety of this platform. Nonetheless, we developed a heterologous scaffold prime-boost using LS and I3 which can help in reducing anti-scaffold responses.</p><p>A challenge facing MERS-CoV vaccine development is the limited number of appropriate animal models for testing protection against clinical virus isolates. Rabbits provide some advantages as an animal model for MERS-CoV. By having the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 expressed in both the upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the rabbits can be naturally infected. This allows the evaluation of both upper and lower respiratory tract MERS-CoV infection and in turn protection using natural field virus isolates rather than adapted strains. However, the animals are not able to develop severe infection such as that seen in severe human cases [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nonetheless, severe infection, thus far, has not been established consistently in any of the other animal models without genetic modification and/or virus adaptation, except for marmosets [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition to the aforementioned, rabbits are readily available and easier to handle compared to other species that can be naturally infected such as non-human primates.</p><p>Following the addition of MERS-CoV as a priority pathogen in the WHO R&#x00026;D Blueprint for action to prevent epidemics, a target product profile was developed which called for three types of MERS-CoV vaccines [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These include one for camels to prevent virus shedding and transmission, and two for humans: a two-dose vaccine for long-term protection of those at continuous high risk such as camel handlers and health-care workers, and a single-dose vaccine for rapid onset of immune responses to protect those at acute risk in outbreak settings. The RBD-LS can be used to develop the two-dose vaccine required to protect the high-risk populations, and can be further optimized using the heterologous scaffold prime/boost scheme developed in this study. Nonetheless, evaluating the longevity of the induced immune responses is warranted. Following the prime, RBD-LS vaccination induced antibody responses of high avidity and MERS-CoV neutralizing capacity. Owing to the robust immune responses induced after one dose, the RBD-LS can be a candidate for developing a rapid single-dose vaccine for MERS-CoV, which is required for reactive use in outbreak situations [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, this vaccine candidate was able to block MERS-CoV replication in the upper respiratory tract of infected rabbit, thus it could potentially be of use as a dromedary vaccine to block MERS-CoV transmission. However, both approaches need to be further validated.</p></sec><sec id="S005"><title>Contributions</title><p>B.L.H. and B,j.B, designed the study.
