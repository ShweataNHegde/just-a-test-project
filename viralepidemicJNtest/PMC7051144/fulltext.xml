MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating virus replication, but whether miRNAs affect CSFV infection is still poorly understood. In previous study, we identified four miRNAs that were down-regulated by CSFV in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC). In this study, miR-140, one of the most potently down-regulated genes was investigated. We found that the miRNA expression was significantly inhibited by CSFV infection. Subsequent studies revealed that miR-140 mimics signi&#x0fb01;cantly inhibited CSFV replication, while the inhibition of endogenous miR-140 enhanced CSFV replication. By using bioinformatics prediction, luciferase reporter system, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot assays, we further demonstrated that miR-140 bind to the 3&#x002b9; UTR of Rab25 mRNA to regulate its expression. We also analyzed the expression pattern of Rab25 in SUVECs after CSFV infection. The results showed that CSFV infection induced Rab25 expression. Finally, Rab25 was found to promote CSFV replication. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that CSFV inhibits miR-140 expression and miR-140 inhibits replication by binding to host factor Rab25.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Classical swine fever virus</kwd><kwd>MIR-140</kwd><kwd>Rab25</kwd><kwd>3&#x002b9; UTR</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31772165</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100011136</named-content></funding-source><award-id>SKLVEB2018-KFKT001</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 31772165, to Y.

Classical swine fever (CSF) is one of the diseases notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health and represents one of the leading worldwide threats to pig industry. Persistent CSFV infection is the leading cause of chronic CSF. Thus, elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of CSFV may largely help to develop effective prevention and control strategies.</p><p>Rab GTPases comprise the largest subfamily of small GTPases and play a master role in regulating intercellular vesicle and protein transport [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. The mammalian genome encodes three Rab11 proteins, Rab11a, Rab11b and Rab11&#x000a0;c (Rab25) and change alternately from GTP- to GDP- [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. The Ras small G protein superfamily have been identified as a key regulator of the intracellular transport system [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. Rab25 is involved in transcytosis, endocytic sorting, and transport [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Currently, it has been reported that the aberrant expression of Rab25 was linked to cancer development and Rab25 is recognized as an oncogene [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>].</p><p>Small RNA (microRNA, miRNA), a regulatory molecule in cells [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>] that participates in a variety of life activities, and are also involved in the interaction of host cells with virus [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. miRNAs are abundant in many types of mammalian cells [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>] and appear to target about 60% of human and mammals genes [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. Many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, which implies that they have important biological functions [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Accumulating studies showed that miRNAs participated in both the virus infection process and the host immune response [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. The host-source miRNAs can directly or indirectly regulate the gene expression of the virus, which play a regulatory role in the viral infection and replication. It has been proved that viral infection leads to significant changes in the expression pattern of miRNA in the host cell and the host-source miRNAs could further regulate host gene expression to combat virus infection. For instance, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the expression of miR-17-5p and miR-20a is down-regulated [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>].</p><p>MiRNAs also can direct regulate virus replication. Previous study found that the expression of the host-source miR-32 could effectively inhibit the genome replication of human foamy virus (PFV). MiR-32 plays an antiviral effect by targeting the PFV genome open reading frame 2 (ORF2) [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. Another way is that microRNAs affect the replication of virus by targeting the non-coding region of host protein gene [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. In our previous study, we identified four miRNAs that were down-regulated by CSFV in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC) [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>] and our unpublished data]. Herein, miR-140, one of the most potently down-regulated genes was investigated. We showed that miR-140 inhibited the replication of CSFV. We further demonstrated the interaction between miR-140 and Rab25. It provides not only new clues to understand the interactions between host and virus but also new potential antiviral strategies for developing anti-CSFV treatment in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Swine umbilical vein endothelial cells (SUVEC) were established and preserved by laboratory and were cultured as previously described [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>].

MiRNAs regulate virus by combining the 3&#x002b9; UTR of the target genes to with degrade or inhibit their expression [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Cellular miRNAs play important roles in regulating virus replication. It has been reported that miR-135a regulates Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by targeting C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2) [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. MiR-30&#x000a0;c promotes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) replication by targeting interferon-alpha/beta receptor beta chain (IFNAR2) [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. In addition, miR-122 repress porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) by down-regulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) and aminopeptidase puromycin sensitive (NPEPPS) [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. However, little is known about the relation between miRNAs in CSFV infection.</p><p>Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly pathogenic infectious disease caused by CSFV. It has a wide range of epidemic and high incidence [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. The classical symptom is extensive systemic bleeding [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. In this study, we had showed that the expression of miR-140 was obviously down-regulated after CSFV infection SUVEC. miR-140 has been reported to play important role in many cellular responses. Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) has an important role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and miR-140 inhibits Mfn1 expression by targeting the 3&#x002b9; UTR [<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>]. miR-140 targets the CXC group of chemokine ligand 12 (CXCl12) and drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein 3 (SMAD3) in chondrocyte differentiation [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>]. In addition, MiR-140 also can suppress liver tumor by targeting the 3&#x002b9; UTR of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. Importantly, miR-140 can suppress NF-&#x003ba;B activity by regulating the expression of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1) and nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (NRIP1) [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. However, a few researches have been investigated its effect on virus replication. In this study, we demonstrated that CSFV infection down-regulated the expression of miR-140. The effect of miR-140 on CSFV replication was also explored by transfecting miR-140 mimics and inhibitors. The results showed that overexpression of miR-140 inhibits CSFV replication and the inhibition of miR-140 promotes CSFV replication.</p><p>Rab proteins are a large class of regulatory proteins and have been proved to be involved in the process of infiltration and replication of CSFV. Rab1A takes part in particle assembly of CSFV [<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>] and Rab2 can promote CSFV replication [<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>]. In addition, Rab5 promotes NS4B induced complex formation and thereby increases CSFV replication [<xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>]. However, the effects of Rab25 on CSFV replication have received little attention. Coincidentally, Rab25 was characterized as the target genes of miR-140 by prediction. Firstly, the miR-140 targeting Rab25 was proved by using double luciferase reporting system, RT-qPCR and Western blot approaches. Then, the data also showed that Rab25 could promote the proliferation of CSFV. In addition, we found that the expression of Rab25 was up-regulated after CSFV infected cells. All these data showed that miR-140 inhibited CSFV replication by targeting Rab25 mRNA 3&#x002b9; UTR. These data suggested that miR-140 inhibits the CSFV replication through the interaction with Rab25. At present, there is very little research regarding the regulation of CSFV in miRNAs. We speculate that Rab25 also has similar regulatory functions since Rab25 is found located in the secretory pathway of the opposite Golgi and Golgi vesicles, and could regulate the transportation through cyclic endosomes [<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>]. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, we investigated the interaction between miR-140, Rab25 proteins with CSFV replication. The miR-140 inhibits CSFV replication through targeting Rab25 and Rab25 support CSFV replication. This study provides mechanism insight into miRNA-viral mRNA interaction and new ideas for controlling CSFV infection.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0006"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>K.K.G., P.P.X, and Y.M.Z. designed the experiments.
