In the present study, we uncovered that penaeidins are a novel family of antiviral effectors against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), which antagonize the envelope proteins to block viral entry. We found that the expression levels of four identified penaeidins from <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>, including <italic>BigPEN</italic>, <italic>PEN2</italic>, <italic>PEN3</italic>, and <italic>PEN4</italic>, were significantly induced in hemocytes during the early stage of WSSV infection. Knockdown of each penaeidin <italic>in vivo</italic> via RNA interference resulted in elevated viral loads and rendered shrimp more susceptible to WSSV, while the survival rate was rescued via the injection of recombinant penaeidins. All penaeidins, except PEN4, were shown to interact with several envelope proteins of WSSV, and all four penaeidins were observed to be located on the outer surface of the WSSV virion. Co-incubation of each recombinant penaeidin with WSSV inhibited virion internalization into hemocytes. More importantly, we found that PEN2 competitively bound to the envelope protein VP24 to release it from polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), the cellular receptor required for WSSV infection. Moreover, we also demonstrated that BigPEN was able to bind to VP28 of WSSV, which disrupted the interaction between VP28 and Rab7 &#x02013; the Rab GTPase that contributes to viral entry by binding with VP28. Taken together, our results demonstrated that penaeidins interact with the envelope proteins of WSSV to block multiple viral infection processes, thereby protecting the host against WSSV.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Penaeidin</kwd><kwd>shrimp</kwd><kwd>WSSV</kwd><kwd>antiviral mechanism</kwd><kwd>viral internalization</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31772883/31930113</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003453</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2016A030306041</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018B020204001</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Tip-top Scientific and Technical Innovative Youth Talents of Guangdong special support program</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100013111</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2016TQ03N504</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Key Research and Development Program of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018YFD0900600/2018YFD0900500</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFD0900600/2018YFD0900500), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31772883/31930113); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars (2016A030306041); Tip-top Scientific and Technical Innovative Youth Talents of Guangdong special support program (2016TQ03N504) and Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2018B020204001).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="57"/><page-count count="23"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The host innate immune system plays a significant role in protecting the organism from pathogenic invasion, particularly in invertebrates, which lack adaptive immunity. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) establish a first line of defense against a large spectrum of pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In general, the antimicrobial mechanism of action of AMPs is thought to involve direct membrane disruption [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, their mechanism of action in defending against viral agents is not very well established. There is growing evidence that the direct interactions between AMPs and structural components of the virion could be a common inhibitory mechanism for destroying or destabilizing the virus and rendering it non-infectious [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In particular, AMPs exhibit antiviral activity by targeting any stage within the life cycle of the virus, including attachment to receptors on the cell surface, endocytic uptake and trafficking, uncoating of the genome, viral replication, and particle assembly and release. For example, human cathelicidins prevent the influenza virus from infecting host cells by directly binding the virus and destroying its membrane [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The mammalian defensin HNP1 directly binds HIV-1 and alters HIV-1 fusion through interactions with glycoprotein-41 [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, human alpha defensins have been shown to bind and stabilize the virus capsid and block adenovirus uncoating to neutralize infection [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Human defensins HNP2 and HD5 have been shown to bind HSV-2 DNA, indicating that these defensins may be able to inhibit infection by blocking gene expression via a post-transcriptional block [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, HNP1&#x02013;3 was shown to inhibit reverse transcription and integration by inhibiting PKC activity, which is important for assembly of the virions [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is an enveloped virus with a dsDNA genome of approximately 300&#x02005;kbp [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. WSSV has a remarkably wide host range, with up to 98 species identified, and has caused enormous economic losses, especially in the shrimp aquaculture [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A model of the WSSV life cycle and morphogenesis primarily includes three phases: (1) entry into the host cell, (2) uncoating of the genome followed by replication, and (3) particle assembly and release [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The first stage of viral entry into the host cell has been thoroughly studied and involves a wide range of molecular interactions between the WSSV envelope proteins and the host [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, the major envelope protein VP28 of WSSV plays a vital role in viral entry into the host cells by interacting with several host factors, such as the C-type lectin isolated from the stomach of <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicus</italic> (MjsvCL) shrimp [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the Rab7 GTPase from <italic>Penaeus monodon</italic> (PmRab7) shrimp [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, an exciting study identified the poly-immunoglobin receptor from <italic>M. japonicas</italic> (MjpIgR) as the transmembrane receptor for WSSV infection, which interacts with the envelope protein VP24 and facilitates viral entry [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, other envelope proteins, including VP53A, VP31, and VP187, have also been found to interact with different host factors to facilitate viral infection [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref>]. All stages of viral infection are suitable targets for the development of antiviral agents to prevent WSSV infection in farmed shrimp [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. AMPs are one class of such agents that significantly block multiple stages within the life cycle of many human and animal viruses [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, acquiring a more thorough understanding of antiviral agents, such as AMP-mediated defense mechanisms in shrimp, may aid in developing new strategies and methods for the treatment and prevention of WSSV infection.</p><p>Penaeidins, which belong to an AMP family initially characterized in the shrimp <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>, play a significant role in antibacterial immunity [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Penaeidins are unique cationic molecules that consist of an N-terminal proline-rich region (PRR) and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region (CRR) with six conserved cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Based on amino acid sequence comparisons and the position of specific amino acids, penaeidins have been previously classified into four distinct subgroups: PEN2, PEN3, PEN4, and PEN5 (as PEN1 turned out to be the variant of PEN2) [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The mRNA level of <italic>PmPEN5</italic> from <italic>P. monodon</italic> was significantly induced upon viral infection, suggesting its possible role in shrimp antiviral immunity [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the antiviral mechanisms of AMPs from invertebrates, including penaeidins, remain elusive.</p><p>In this study, we examined the mechanism of inhibition of WSSV infection by penaeidins. We found that penaeidins have potent anti-WSSV activity. These molecules block WSSV infection by disrupting the interactions of viral envelope proteins with essential host factors, such as VP28&#x02013;Rab7 and VP24-pIgR, thereby preventing virus-mediated entry into host cells. These studies reveal the antiviral mechanism of penaeidins, which highlight a new antiviral strategy that has the potential to be employed to control WSSV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Purification of intact WSSV viral particles</title><p>Virions were isolated from WSSV-infected shrimp following a previously published method [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

All four penaeidins contained a conserved PEN domain that consisted of a PRR and CRR (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). The PEN domain from each penaeidin contained six conservative cysteines (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B).

By quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), we observed that the four penaeidins were mainly expressed in hemocytes of na&#x000ef;ve (uninfected) shrimp (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;F), and thus the hemocyte was used as the target tissue in the following studies. In regard to penaeidins as conventional AMPs, a Gram-negative bacterium, <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus,</italic> was chosen as a control pathogen, and the expression levels of penaeidins after WSSV infection were compared to the expression levels of penaeidins after <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection. We found that both pathogens markedly induced the expression of all four penaeidins during the early stages of infection in hemocytes (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G&#x02013;J). In particular, the upregulation of <italic>BigPEN</italic> and <italic>PEN2</italic> 4&#x02013;12 hours after <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection was increased as compared to WSSV infection.

We designed and synthesized different dsRNAs, namely dsRNA-BigPEN, dsRNA-PEN2, dsRNA-PEN3, and dsRNA-PEN4, which specifically targeted <italic>BigPEN</italic>, <italic>PEN2</italic>, <italic>PEN3</italic>, and <italic>PEN4</italic>, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, the mRNA level of each penaeidin was effectively suppressed by the corresponding gene-specific dsRNA at 48 hours post dsRNA injection. After the knockdown of the penaeidins, the shrimp were infected with WSSV by intramuscular injection, and the viral load (WSSV DNA copies) in each penaeidin-silenced shrimp was determined by absolute quantitative PCR (absolute q-PCR) at 48&#x02005;hpi. We observed that a greater number of penaeidin-silenced shrimp exhibited higher quantities of viral titres in muscles when compared to the control shrimp (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). To further demonstrate the anti-WSSV role of penaeidins, <italic>in vivo</italic> RNAi experiments coupled with rPenaeidins were performed. Our results showed that shrimp co-injected with rPenaeidins and dsRNA had significantly reduced viral replication levels as compared to the control group (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). These results strongly indicated that all four penaeidins can inhibit WSSV replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. To investigate whether changes in expression of each penaeidin mediated viral replication levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, survival rate experiments were performed and recorded. We observed that only knockdown of PEN2 resulted in remarkably lower survival rates than the GFP dsRNA control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0135&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>E). Nevertheless, shrimp with knockdown of BigPEN, PEN3, or PEN4 still showed reduced survival rates to some extent, despite no significant difference in the statistical analysis compared with the corresponding control group (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>D, F, and G).

This phenomenon could result from the effect of the knockdown of a single penaeidin via RNAi <italic>in vivo</italic>, the function of which might be compensated by other penaeidins or effectors in an unidentified mechanism; however, injection of rPenaeidin not only rescued the silenced penaeidin but also conferred increased protection to shrimp against WSSV infection. In summary, these results convincingly demonstrated that penaeidins are a class of critical antiviral factors against <italic>in vivo</italic> WSSV infection.

To clarify the possible anti-WSSV mechanism of penaeidins, a pull-down assay was performed to detect whether penaeidin proteins could interact with WSSV envelope proteins. Since BigPEN contained an additional N-terminal RPT domain and conserved C-terminal PEN domain that consisted of a PRR and CRR (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), the full-length (BigPEN-FL), RPT domain (BigPEN-R), and C-terminal PEN domain (BigPEN-PEN) with His-tags were expressed and purified (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A and B). Several envelope proteins of WSSV, including VP19, VP24, VP26, VP28, and VP16 with GST-tags, were also expressed and purified (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). In the GST pull-down assays, we observed by Coomassie blue staining that GST-tagged viral proteins, including VP26, VP28, and VP16, precipitated BigPEN-FL (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D, upper panel, lanes 4&#x02212;6), and we further confirmed this result by western blotting with a His-tag antibody (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D, down panel). In the His-tagged BigPEN-FL pull-down assays with five WSSV envelope proteins (GST-tagged), we obtained an identical result showing that BigPEN-FL precipitated VP26, VP28, and VP16 (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>E). Besides, to verify whether rBigPEN-FL was able to interact with VP28 from WSSV infected hemocytes, we performed a pull-down assay by rBigPEN-FL and VP28 (<italic>in vivo</italic>) in hemocytes during WSSV infection. The result showed that rBigPEN could interact with the VP28 from the hemocyte lysates at 24 hours post WSSV infection (Supplementary Figure 1). To further verify which domain of BigPEN was able to interact with WSSV envelope proteins, two separate domains, including BigPEN-R and BigPEN-PEN, were used in pull-down assays. In both of the GST pull-down and His pull-down assays, we observed that BigPEN-PEN, but not BigPEN-R (the RPT domain), was able to interact with VP26, VP28, and VP16 (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>F&#x02013;I). Collectively, these results strongly demonstrated that the C-terminal PEN domain of BigPEN is able to interact with WSSV envelope proteins, including VP26, VP28, and VP16 (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>J).

To address this, GST pull-down and His pull-down assays were performed in order to explore the possible interaction between PEN2, PEN3, and PEN4 and the five viral proteins purified above.

Although PEN4 failed to interact with the five tested viral envelope proteins, PEN4 was able to interact with the outer surface of WSSV virions, which suggested that PEN4 might have the ability to bind other envelope proteins rather than the five tested proteins in this study.

The cells were infected with WSSV premixed with the purified rPEN2 or rTrx protein for one hour or remained uninfected. After WSSV infection, the DNA of the cells was isolated and subjected to quantitative PCR assay to detect WSSV DNA. The expression of LvpIgR in HEK293T cells was confirmed by western blot analysis after transfection (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>F2), which showed that LvpIgR exhibited some homo-oligomerization properties, similar to a previous report [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Viral DNA was detected in the pcDNA3-pIgR transfected HEK293T cells, but not in the cells transfected with the empty vector (<xref rid="F0008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>F3), which confirmed that LvpIgR was a bona fide receptor for WSSV internalization.

The WSSV infection rate of HEK293T cells was then calculated. Purified rTrx was used as a control. The WSSV infection rate of cells preincubated with rTrx was 49.08% (control).

To address whether Dorsal and Relish were able to regulate the expression of penaeidins <italic>in vitro</italic>, a dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were performed. We first obtained the promoter regions of the four penaeidins, including <italic>BigPEN, PEN2, PEN3,</italic> and <italic>PEN4,</italic> by a genome walking method (Supplementary data 1) and then cloned them into the pGL3-Basic vectors. We observed that overexpression of <italic>L. vannamei</italic> Dorsal or Relish could significantly induce the promoter activities of all four penaeidins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref rid="F0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>C).

We analyzed the 5&#x02032; flanking regulatory region of <italic>BigPEN</italic> and found that it contained two conserved &#x003ba;B motifs located at &#x02212;349 to &#x02212;339 (&#x003ba;B1, GTGTTTTTCGC) and &#x02212;91 to &#x02212;81 (&#x003ba;B2, GTGTTTTTTAC) (<xref rid="F0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>D). Four vectors, including the wild-type promoter region, termed pGL3-&#x003ba;B12, pGL3-&#x003ba;B-M1, pGL3-&#x003ba;B-M2, and pGL3-&#x003ba;B-M12 vectors, with a deletion mutant of one or both &#x003ba;B sites (<xref rid="F0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>D), were constructed to perform dual-luciferase reporter assays. We found that the promoter activities of pGL3-&#x003ba;B12, pGL3-&#x003ba;B-M1, and pGL3-&#x003ba;B-M2 were upregulated by <italic>L. vannamei</italic> Dorsal overexpressed in S2 cells with 3.09-, 1.93-, 1.40-fold increases, respectively, whereas the activity of pGL3-&#x003ba;B-M12 was not upregulated (<xref rid="F0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>E). These results suggested that Dorsal was able to interact with the conserved &#x003ba;B sites within the promoter region of <italic>BigPEN</italic>. To address this, an EMSA was performed using the purified 6His-tagged RHD domain of Dorsal protein (rDorsal-RHD) expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.

For example, two <italic>Drosophila</italic> AMPs, attC and dptB, have been demonstrated to restrict Sindbis virus (SINV) infection, but the actual antiviral mechanism is still unknown [<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Herein, four penaeidins identified in <italic>L. vannamei,</italic> including BigPEN, PEN2, PEN3, and PEN4, were assessed in their potential anti-WSSV activities. The critical role of penaeidins during an innate anti-WSSV response was demonstrated by using RNAi <italic>in vivo</italic> to silence each individual penaeidin. We observed that knockdown of each penaeidin resulted in higher viral loads, whereas each purified penaeidin could effectively confer protection to shrimp against the WSSV. In addition, we identified that the antiviral mechanism of penaeidins involved blocking viral internalization and disrupting the process of infection. In summary, we show for the first time that penaeidins are a novel class of anti-WSSV effectors in shrimp.</p><p>The production of antiviral effectors represents a major host defense mechanism against viruses in invertebrates, including shrimp [<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Since invertebrates lack an adaptive immune response, it is rationalized that identifying and characterizing novel antiviral molecules may shed light onto the innate antiviral response in shrimp. In this study, we focused our attention on penaeidins due to the following aspects: (i) penaeidins are a type of AMP that are abundant in penaeid shrimps; (ii) the four penaeidins from <italic>L. vannamei</italic> were significantly induced by WSSV infection (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A); and (iii) the antiviral activities of penaeidins against the WSSV have not been previously uncovered. In fact, similar to our observations, previous studies have also shown that <italic>L. vannamei</italic> PEN2, PEN3, and PEN4 were strongly upregulated during the early stage of WSSV infection [<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], indicating that penaeidins play an important role in the innate antiviral response during early WSSV infection to prevent WSSV dissemination. In order to comprehensively analyze the entire family of penaeidins during viral infection, we cloned a paralog, termed BigPEN as it contained an additional RPT domain. All reported penaeidins from shrimp can be clustered into three subgroups, and each subgroup contained one or two penaeidins from <italic>L. vannamei</italic>. Specifically, PEN3 is located in subgroup 1; PEN2 and PEN4 are located in subgroup 2; and BigPEN is located in subgroup 3 (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Since the structure of penaeidins is conserved within the subgroups, it is possible that each subgroup also has similar functions. In this model, the function of <italic>L. vannamei</italic> BigPEN, PEN2, PEN3, and PEN4 during WSSV infection could be representative, to some extent, of those penaeidins in other shrimps.</p><p>The name of penaeidins comes from the originality of their structure and the fact that they are only found in penaeid shrimps [<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Penaeidins are composed of a conserved PEN domain, including a PRR and a CRR, which contains six cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bridges [<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, we identified BigPEN, which contained an RPT domain prior to the PEN domain. It was apparent that the RPT domain was not able to interact with the five tested viral proteins (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>H and I) or the outer surface of WSSV virion (Supplementary Figure 2C). However, the actual function of the RPT domain is still unknown. In contrast, the PEN domain is conserved and has been demonstrated to be able to interact with one or more viral envelope proteins. Although PEN4 failed to interact with the five tested viral proteins, it may still interact with other viral proteins, as shown by its capability to bind to the outer surface of WSSV virions. This was further supported by rPEN4, which like the other three penaeidins, conferred hemocytes protection against WSSV entry.</p><p>The most probable scenario is that the antiviral activity of penaeidins is due to the direct interaction between the WSSV and penaeidins, which would inhibit viral entry into target cells. Our current studies have provided several lines of evidence strongly supporting this notion. First, all four penaeidins were able to interact with the outer surface of the WSSV virion, and all, except PEN4, were shown to bind one or more of the five tested viral proteins. Second, the purified penaeidin proteins inhibited WSSV entry into hemocytes and significantly reduced the infection rate of hemocytes by WSSV virions. Finally, PEN2 and BigPEN directly interacted with VP24 and VP28 of WSSV, respectively, and interfered with the binding of these viral proteins to host factors. The exact antiviral mechanism of penaeidins against WSSV could be their ability to disrupt the processes of viral infection. In this study, the identified penaeidin-binding viral proteins were VP24, VP26, VP28, and VP16 &#x02013; most of which play significant roles in WSSV infection. VP24 is a chitin-binding protein and deemed to be a key factor involved in WSSV infection [<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Importantly, VP24 has recently been identified as the viral receptor-binding protein, which has been shown to interact with the cellular receptor of MjpIgR from <italic>M. japonicus</italic> shrimp to mediate WSSV entry into host cells [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this study, we also demonstrated that VP24 mediated WSSV penetration into non-permissive cells (HEK293T) via LvpIgR, indicating that LvpIgR from <italic>L. vannamei</italic> shrimp is a bona fide cellular receptor for WSSV internalization. VP26 was identified as an integral linker protein and was shown to bind to host actin to help transport virions into host cells [<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. VP28 is located on the outer surface of WSSV and was shown to be involved in viral attachment to and penetration of shrimp cells [<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, VP28 has been shown to interact with Rab7 of <italic>P. monodon</italic> (PmRab7), which has been shown to contribute to effective infection [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The interaction between VP28 and PmRab7 has been implicated in the WSSV infection process, most likely the step involving viral escape from the endosome [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We also observed that VP28 interacted with LvRab7, which has 100% sequence identity to PmRab7, indicating that the function of LvRab7 was similar to that of PmRab7. We provided evidence that PEN2 interacted with VP24 and interfered with VP24 binding to the viral receptor LvpIgR, thus inhibiting WSSV entry into cells. Additionally, BigPEN interfered with VP28 binding to LvRab7, which probably inhibited the trafficking of endosomes.</p><p>In addition, interactions between envelope proteins are common in enveloped viruses, and they might form complexes that have specific roles in host-viral interactions or the infectivity of viruses [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A similar situation has also been observed in the enveloped virus of WSSV. VP24, VP26, and VP28 share sequence homology and can form a complex termed an &#x0201c;infectosome&#x0201d; that has been regarded to be crucial to the infectivity of WSSV [<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is important to note that we are still unclear whether the interaction of penaeidins with viral proteins will interfere with the formation of an &#x0201c;infectosome&#x0201d; or other complexes involving host and viral proteins. Nevertheless, based on our results and previous observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the binding of penaeidins to viral envelope proteins attenuates WSSV infectivity and inhibits WSSV internalization.</p><p>A common innate defense mechanism in invertebrates, including shrimps, is that immune signalling pathways, such as Toll, IMD, and JAK/STAT pathways, regulate the production of specific sets of effectors for antiviral defense [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Identification of which pathway is responsible for the transcriptional expression of penaeidins in shrimps will help us better understand their mediated immune response to WSSV infection. Our results suggested that both Dorsal and Relish (NF-&#x003ba;B), the downstream transcription factors of Toll and IMD pathways, respectively, could be involved in the regulation of the four penaeidins after WSSV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. This observation was further confirmed via an EMSA that showed that Dorsal was able to interact with the canonical &#x003ba;B motif within the promoter region of <italic>BigPEN in vitro</italic>. It is important to note that one or both &#x003ba;B motifs could also be responsive to Relish, as Relish strongly induced the expression of BigPEN <italic>in vitro</italic> as determined by dual reporter gene assays (<xref rid="F0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>C). Similar situations have also been reported. For example, a &#x003ba;B motif within the promoter of WSSV IE1 (<italic>wsv069</italic>) has been demonstrated to be dual-responsive &#x02013; that is, regulated by either Dorsal or Relish [<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a single &#x003ba;B motif in the promoter of Metchnikowin (<italic>Mtk</italic>) has been shown to bind both DIF and Relish [<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Additionally, other signalling pathways may also regulate the expression of some penaeidins, as shown by the presence of several regulatory factor-binding motifs, such as NF-&#x003ba;B, GATA, STAT, and AP-1, within the promoter regions of penaeidins [<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Thus, we propose that the Toll and IMD signalling pathways, perhaps via crosstalk with other pathways, work together in a collaborative manner to regulate the expression of penaeidins in response to WSSV infection. Such a regulatory pattern might be able to provide a rapid and tailored immune response against a viral invasion.</p><p>In summary, for the first time we have identified penaeidins as a novel class of innate antiviral factors against WSSV. Based on our results, we proposed a model for the function of penaeidins in the innate antiviral response (<xref rid="F0011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>). Infection of host cells with WSSV results in the activation of the Toll and IMD (NF-&#x003ba;B related) signalling pathways that induce the production of penaeidins, including BigPEN, PEN2, PEN3, and PEN4. These secreted penaeidins restrict WSSV infection by antagonizing viral envelope proteins, which results in the blockade of multiple viral infection processes. Specifically, PEN2 interferes with the ability of the receptor-binding protein VP24 to bind to the host receptor LvpIgR, thereby blocking viral entry into the target cells. In addition, BigPEN interferes with VP28 binding to LvRab7 &#x02013; a key regulator for viral endocytosis &#x02013; which disrupts WSSV internalization. Furthermore, other penaeidins could abrogate infection by a similar mechanism. Therefore, this study provides insights into the development of antiviral agents that target viral infection processes.
<fig id="F0011" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Model for penaeidins-mediated antiviral mechanisms against WSSV. Infection of host cells by WSSV results in activation of two NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathways, which trigger the synthesis and secretion of penaeidins, including BigPEN, PEN2, PEN3, and PEN4. These secreted penaeidins restrict WSSV infection by interacting with the virion particles and antagonizing viral envelope proteins, which results in the blockade of multiple viral infection processes. In particular, PEN2 interferes with the receptor-binding protein VP24 to bind the host receptor LvpIgR, blocking viral entry into the target cells. In addition, BigPEN interferes with VP28-LvRab7 interaction, disrupting WSSV endocytosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="TEMI_A_1729068_F0011_OC"/></fig></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6002"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="TEMI_A_1729068_SM6002.doc" orientation="portrait" id="d37e189" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFD0900600/2018YFD0900500), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31772883/31930113); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars (2016A030306041); Tip-top Scientific and Technical Innovative Youth Talents of Guangdong special support program (2016TQ03N504) and Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2018B020204001).
