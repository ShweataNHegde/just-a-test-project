Evidence from the 2013&#x02013;2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak indicated that different genotypes of the virus can have different phenotypes in patients. Additionally, due to the error-prone nature of viral RNA synthesis in an individual patient, the EBOV genome exists around a dominant viral genome sequence. The minor variants within a patient may contribute to the overall phenotype in terms of viral protein function. To investigate the effects of these minor variants, blood samples from patients with acute EVD were deeply sequenced.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We examine the minor variant frequency between patients with acute EVD who survived infection with those who died. Non-synonymous differences in viral proteins were identified that have implications for viral protein function. The greatest frequency of substitution was identified at three codon sites in the L gene&#x02014;which encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Recapitulating this in an assay for virus replication, these substitutions result in aberrant viral RNA synthesis and correlate with patient outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Together, these findings support the notion that in patients who survived EVD, in some cases, the genetic variability of the virus resulted in deleterious mutations that affected viral protein function, leading to reduced viral load. Such mutations may also lead to persistent strains of the virus and be associated with recrudescent infections.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Ebola virus</kwd><kwd>Ebola virus disease</kwd><kwd>Virus genetics</kwd><kwd>Evolution</kwd><kwd>Patient outcome</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">The major contribution to outcome in patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) is viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, viral genome variants between patients may have different phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Host factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and co-infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] will also contribute to survival or a fatal outcome. Similar to other viruses with RNA genomes, the fidelity of EBOV RNA genome replication and RNA synthesis is influenced by the processivity of the L protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, there exist potential genome modifications resulting from nucleotide changes by the action of cellular proteins involved in RNA processing, including adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) (inducing an A to G transition) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Any perturbation in the fidelity of genome replication that increases the rate of mutation can lead to error catastrophe where synonymous and non-synonymous changes lead to a degradation of viral protein function and a loss in viral RNA synthesis. This can be exploited therapeutically where drugs such as ribavirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and favipiravir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] can be used to drive the replication of RNA viruses towards being less fit.</p><p id="Par5">The high nucleotide substitution rate can drive the selection of genotypic and phenotypic variants of EBOV that allows the virus to occupy new niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is evidenced in the ability of EBOV to gain virulence in a small animal model to which it is not initially adapted to replicate (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). Concomitant adaptations in viral proteins, such as VP24, were present in the minor variant population before they became established as a dominant viral genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whilst variation and potential functional changes in the dominant viral genome sequence have been compared between patients, the understanding of minor variants and their frequency and how these contribute to the overall viral phenotype within a patient is unknown. The opportunity to investigate this in natural infections of EBOV in the human population will diminish with the potential use of medical countermeasures that may drive selection pressures such as favipiravir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and monoclonal antibody therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as supportive care becomes more prevalent.</p><p id="Par6">To investigate the diversity underlying dominant viral genome sequences in patients with EBOV, we examined transcriptome data from blood samples that we had either previously sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or that had been sequenced for this study. These samples represented diagnostic leftover material used by the European Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) and were sampled from patients with EVD at presentation to the Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Guinea (2013&#x02013;2016). The main differential was that the patients then went on to survive (termed hospitalised survivor) or die (termed hospitalised fatal). Our hypothesis was that viral populations may be different between individual patients in the acute phase EVD, and this contributed to the outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">To ensure equivalence of samples in terms of length of infection (which may have influenced viral load and genome diversity), self-reported information from patients was used. Samples were selected so that there was no significant difference in the mean-time to the onset of symptoms for the hospitalised survivor group (6.4&#x02009;days) and for the hospitalised fatal group (5.9&#x02009;days). In terms of sequence quality, data from the blood samples was included if the final assembled dominant EBOV genome sequence was longer than 18,800 nucleotides and without gap (N). Using both equivalence of infection and sequence read quality to filter for sample quality, the numbers of samples for comparison were 38 hospitalised survivors and 96 hospitalised fatal cases. The general statistics of these cases are summarised in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1.</p><p id="Par8">Reflecting the observations from Guinea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], on average, the EBOV load was significantly higher in acute patients at presentation in the hospitalised fatal group compared to the hospitalised survivor group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). To determine the viral genome population in an individual, reads were mapped to a reference EBOV genome to call a dominant viral genome sequence. This was used as a template in the second round of mapping to generate the reference EBOV genome for each individual patient. The variation in the four nucleotides at each site along the reference EBOV genome was counted for the individual patient. A sliding window of 200 nucleotides was used to derive and compare the average frequency in nucleotide variation along the genome.

These corresponded to the transition and transversion variations from the dominant viral genome sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c). In general, the frequency of minor variants which represented transitions was higher than the frequency of transversions. The variation in the frequency of both transition and transversion deviations was broader in the hospitalised survivor group compared to the hospitalised fatal group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). To investigate the distribution of these deviations across the genome, the average frequency of the minor variants was plotted along the EBOV genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). This showed there were regions along the genome, including the L gene, that exhibited greater deviation from the dominant viral genome sequence and also that in a region of GP, transversions were more frequent than transitions in EBOV genomes from hospitalised survivors compared to hospitalised fatal cases (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1).</p><p id="Par10">The frequency of deviation from the dominant viral genome sequence may have been influenced by viral load, and the more genomes present, the more variation might exist. To investigate this, a Spearman rank correlation test was performed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). This showed that the frequency of transition and transversion deviations from the dominant viral genome sequence was negatively related to viral load. The data implied a greater diversity in EBOV genomes in patients with lower viral loads compared to patients with high viral loads. A generalised linear model (glm) was used to investigate this observation and showed no significant difference in the slope and intercept between survivors and fatalities in any plot of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). This suggested, in dominant viral genome sequence present in hospitalised survivors and hospitalised fatal cases at presentation, with the same viral load, there were no differences in transitions or transversions.</p><p id="Par11">The minor variant population may have resulted in non-synonymous changes that had functional divergence from the dominant viral genome sequence, resulting in differences in the primary amino acid sequence from that coded by dominant viral genome. This would lead to neutral, loss or gain in function of the affected viral protein. If the minor variant formed a significant proportion of the virus population, then any changes in viral protein function due to the minor variant may have had an overall effect on the activity of the viral protein in the infection.</p><p id="Par12">To investigate this, the amino acid sequence space for all EBOV proteins was determined and the contribution of minor variants compared to the dominant viral genome sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). In general, minor variants resulted in a small frequency of changes to the background protein sequence in all of the EBOV proteins (the dominant viral genome sequence by definition was still the majority sequence). However, in VP24 and L, there were several peaks where the frequency of the minor variants would have resulted in 20% or more of the protein space having a different amino acid at that position (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The minor variant changes in VP24 led to one amino acid being present in the minor variants that was different from the dominant viral genome sequence but was similar for both hospitalised survivor and hospitalised fatal cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In the L protein, three of these sites between hospitalised survivor and hospitalised fatal cases showed the highest difference with the most significant <italic>P</italic> values than all other amino acid sites of EBOV proteins: positions 572, 986 and 2061 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S2). These deviations from the dominant viral genome sequence had a strong negative correlation with viral load (for each position the <italic>R</italic> value was less than &#x02212;&#x02009;0.69 (range &#x02212;&#x02009;1 to +&#x02009;1) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c&#x02013;e). These changes were mostly transversions, except at position 986, where these were predominately transitions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Also, a glm showed significant differences of slope and intercept between survivors and fatalities in the data presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c&#x02013;e (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). This suggested that the frequency of non-synonymous changes at positions 572, 986 and 2061 of the L protein under the same viral load (1/Ct value) was significantly different between hospitalised survivors and hospitalised fatalities.

These include N572S, Q986R and F2061S and are more frequent in the EBOV minor variant population in the hospitalised survivor group than the hospitalised fatal group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Moreover, their usage correlated with a lower viral load in patients and therefore the hospitalised survivor category (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). One of the deviations from the dominant genome sequence in the L protein at position 986 was for a stop codon and would have resulted in a truncated L protein. This stop codon was present in a greater frequency, although in less patients, in the hospitalised survivor versus hospitalised fatal cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b). For example, in one hospitalised survivor, the stop protein at position 986 reached a frequency of approximately 15% in the minor variant population. Indeed, stop codons were present at low frequency in all EBOV proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), but it appeared more frequently at position 986 in the L protein than any other position in viral proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Similar to the other amino acid changes caused by minor variants at positions 572, 986 and 2061, the stop codon frequency at position 986 was more frequent in hospitalised survivors than hospitalised fatal cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, b) and was also negatively related to viral load (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d).

Here, viral proteins required for RNA synthesis, L, NP, VP30 and VP35, are provided <italic>in trans</italic> from helper expression plasmids. These drive the replication of the mini-genome and transcription of a luciferase reporter mRNA whose cDNA has been inserted between the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; UTRs of the EBOV genome. Such systems have been shown to faithfully recapitulate viral RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The insertion of the luciferase cDNA, and concomitant activity of the luciferase reporter protein, provides a rapid readout for functional analysis of viral proteins and variants, through substitution in the helper expression plasmids.</p><p id="Par16">The activity of the truncated L protein, through the replacement of the Q at position 986 with a stop codon (referred to as L<sub>STOP</sub>), was compared to the wild-type L protein. Here, the activity of luciferase was compared between mini-genome systems supported by the L protein expression plasmid, or where this plasmid was excluded, or a combination of both the L protein and L<sub>STOP</sub> expression plasmids or the L<sub>STOP</sub> expression plasmid only. All of the other support plasmids, expressing NP, VP30 and VP35, were provided as normal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). Western blot confirmed the expression of L and L<sub>STOP</sub>. In line with previous observations, excluding the L protein led to background observable luciferase activity compared to wild-type L protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). As the ratio of L<sub>STOP</sub> to L expression plasmid was increased, there was a decreasing luciferase activity, such that with L<sub>STOP</sub> only, the level of luciferase was not significantly different from excluding the L protein expression plasmid (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4). This suggested that the L<sub>STOP</sub> could not function as a RdRp. To investigate the potential loss of the overall function of the L protein activity, increasing amounts of the L<sub>STOP</sub> expression plasmid were titrated in, with equivalent amounts of pUC57 added to maintain the total amount of DNA during transfection. Here, for all amounts of the L<sub>STOP</sub> expression plasmid tested, there was a significant reduction in luciferase activity from using the L expression plasmid only (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5). However, there was no significant difference in luciferase activity for all of the amounts of the L<sub>STOP</sub>. Given that N572S, Q986R and F2061S substitution as a result of minor variants could be present in the same patient (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). To evaluate the activity of these mutations in the context of the L protein, an expression variant called L<sub>3mut</sub> was constructed where all three mutations were present. The data indicated that the activity of L<sub>3mut</sub> was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type L protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6), including when both wild-type L protein and L<sub>3mut</sub> were expressed at the same time.</p><p id="Par17">From this, we postulated that not only did these minor variant proteins have no (L<sub>STOP</sub>) or reduced activity (L<sub>3mut</sub>), they may also have acted as a sink to sequester other viral proteins required for viral RNA synthesis away from the dominant viral genome sequence for the L protein. To test this hypothesis, the capability of L<sub>STOP</sub> to interact with VP35, a known polymerase cofactor for the L protein, and essential for replication and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], was examined. The ability of L<sub>STOP</sub> to associate with VP35 was compared to L protein using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Here, VP35 had been C-terminal tagged in frame with enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) (forming VP35-eGFP) to allow co-immunoprecipitation with a highly specific single-chain antibody. This approach has been used to study the interacting partners of a wide variety of viral proteins, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although somewhat diminished compared to wild-type VP35, VP35-eGFP, in the context of the mini-genome system, still allowed the generation of luciferase activity (data not shown), suggesting the protein was still biologically active, through its interactions with the L protein. Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that VP35-eGFP could be used to pull down either the L protein or L<sub>STOP</sub> protein but not NP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7). Overall, the data is supportive of a model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>g) in which the presence of L<sub>STOP</sub> protein contributes to the reduction in viral load in patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>g, inset panel) possibly through both the absence of RdRp activity and the ability to act as a sink for viral proteins otherwise required for RNA synthetic activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par18">The analysis of minor variant populations of EBOV in infected patients paints an interesting picture for their contribution to the outcome of EVD. In this study, we focused on the diversity found in viral populations in a cohort of patients with EVD where a blood sample was taken during the acute phase, and where patients then went on to survive or die. RNA-seq was used to generate sequence data to derive the dominant viral genome sequence within a patient and establish the frequency of minor variants. Within this minor variant pool were potential non-synonymous changes that may have had profound effects on the activity of EBOV proteins. In the case of data from patients with differing outcomes associated with EVD, three amino acid substitutions that were present on the L protein in the minor variant viral population within a patient were shown to have phenotypic consequences for replication/transcription of the viral genome. Substitution of these amino acids in the dominant genome sequence for the L protein resulted in aberrant viral RNA synthesis in the context of a replicon system. We postulate these divergent proteins may also act as a sink for other viral (and host) proteins involved in RNA synthesis, which associate and function through protein to protein interactions. Therefore, the net effect resulted in reduced viral RNA synthesis, which may have contributed to the lower viral load observed in patients containing viral populations with these variants.</p><p id="Par19">Viral genome variation is not the only contributor to the outcome, although it does play a significant role in the patients we analysed. How viral diversity may be generated inside a patient is unknown, and this may be related to an initial large viral population infecting a patient and/or host mechanisms. Infection may result from a single or a small number of founder viruses that emerge from a genetic bottleneck. This is supported by studies in a guinea pig model of infection, where specific variations in the genome sequence become predominant and are associated with gain of virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These variations are present in the minor variant population and on the passage in the animal model become the dominant viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. At a more general level, the correlation between viral genome diversity and severity of clinical symptoms has also been described for hepatitis C virus, where viral genome diversity in asymptomatic carriers was greater than in patients with severe disease and explained from a population genetics view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Both host effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and the presence of other infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] will undoubtedly contribute to the outcome in EVD. The host response to EBOV infection is a major determinant of disease severity in EVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], as well as the timing and magnitude of transcriptional regulatory networks, where early induction of inflammatory gene expression is associated with an asymptomatic course of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The host response at the acute stage in many of the patients covered in this study was investigated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Here, read mapping to the human genome was used to identify and quantify changes in mRNA profiles between hospitalised survivors and hospital fatal infections. Digital cell quantification and flow cytometry was used to investigate differences in the immunological phenotype of the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The host response may affect viral population genetics through selection pressure. The caveat is that our study and the work described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] are based on a single snapshot of infection (on average day 6 post-infection based on self-reporting from a patient or their family) and therefore do not encompass the entire immune response, and in particular, the adaptative response. In patients who went on die, at the acute phase, there was a stronger upregulation of interferon signalling compared to patients who went on to survive. Also, in this latter group of patients, a greater abundance in NK cell populations was predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A severe T cell dysfunction is associated with fatal EVD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and non-antigen-specific activation of lymphocytes T and B has been associated with a higher production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may lead to immune impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and therefore influence the dominant viral genome and minor variant population. From a more innate/intrinsic immunity perspective, several proteins within the cell may affect viral genome sequences. The predominant transition variation in the EBOV genome was an A to G substitution (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3) which is reminiscent of ADAR activity. Whether ADAR activity is more enhanced in hospitalised survivors versus hospitalised fatal cases is unknown. ADAR activity can be associated with cellular localisation and therefore was not possible to examine in the context of the diagnostic leftover RNA sample. However, we note that in EBOV-infected A549 cells, a human cell line with a strong innate response, ADAR transcripts were increased in abundance compared to mock-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The potential attenuation of viral replication through variation in the L protein may have several implications. First, the data may provide mechanistic insight into why favipiravir would potentially be effective in human patients with lower viral loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In a non-human primate model of EVD, favipiravir has been shown to increase mutagenesis during EBOV RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, together with the potentially higher variability of EBOV in patients who go on to survive (and have lower viral loads), flavipiravir may tip the balance towards error catastrophe during viral replication. Second, there have many cases of potential persistence associated with a recrudescence in EBOV infection, including in the testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the ocular fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These observations are also reflected in animal models of persistent asymptomatic infection with EBOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Recently, a model for the persistence of acute viral infections, such as those observed in paramyxoviruses, has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. EBOV has a similar genome organisation and replication strategy to paramyxoviruses. In this model, as the adaptive immune response develops during infection, genome variants are selected in which replication is suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This would lead to persistent infection at low levels, and the switch back to a lytic stage would be associated with amino acid reversions causing virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In the paramyxovirus, parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV), a single amino acid change in the viral P protein, a key component of the viral RNA polymerase complex, was found to control the switch from persistence to lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The observation of the attenuating N572S, Q986R and F2061S variants in the EBOV L protein was associated with reduced polymerase activity and correlated with lower viral load in patients. Therefore, we postulate that such mutations with phenotypic consequences of severely reducing viral replication may be a mechanism that results in persistence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par22">Our analysis was based on a single snapshot of infection, when a diagnostic sample was taken when patients presented to an Ebola virus treatment centre, with an acute (at the time) undiagnosed febrile illness.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A codon-optimised L gene for expression in human cells was derived from the Makona strain [NCBI sequence reference number KJ660347.2] with either a stop codon at amino acid position 986 (referred as L<sub>STOP</sub>) or with amino acid changes N&#x0003e;S, Q&#x0003e;R and F&#x0003e;S at positions 572, 986 and 2061 (referred as L<sub>3mut</sub>), respectively. These were cloned into the expression vector pUC57. The transcription of the viral gene was under the control of a T7 polymerase promoter. A codon-optimised cDNA sequence for human cell expression encoding the viral protein VP35 was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector for the expression of EBOV Makona strain VP35 [NCBI sequence reference number KJ660347.2] with a C-terminal eGFP tag. The Invitrogen GeneArt Gene Synthesis service (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for plasmid design, cloning and codon optimisation of the coding sequences. SURE competent cells (Agilent) were used for the production of the mini-genome system plasmids pMG, pL, pVP30, pVP35, pNP, pRLTK, pL<sub>3mut</sub> and pL<sub>STOP</sub>. Subcloning efficiency DH5&#x003b1; competent cells (Invitrogen) were used to transform peGFP-N1 and peGFP according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. For the preparation of the plasmids, the QIAGEN&#x000ae; Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen) was used. For each maxiprep, 0.5&#x02009;L of turbid overnight culture of plasmid DNA-containing bacteria with the correspondent selective antibiotic was used as input. cDNA plasmids were eluted and resuspended in 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of nuclease-free water. Plasmid stock concentrations were measured by NanoDrop ONE spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Endonuclease digestion was performed with SacI-HF, SalI-HF and BglII-HF (New England Biolab) on plasmid DNA to obtain linear fragments and to determine their size by electrophoresis for screening purposes.
