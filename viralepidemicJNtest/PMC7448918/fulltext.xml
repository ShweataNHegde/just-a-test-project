Recently, it was demonstrated that Cas12a exhibits unspecific ssDNAse activity upon target recognition. This feature allows CRISPR-Cas to be coupled with a ssDNA reporter and generate a fast, accurate and ultrasensitive molecular detection method. Here, we demonstrate that Cas12a was able to detect DNA target sequences corresponding to carbapenemases resistance genes such as KPC, NDM and OXA. Also, with the addition of a reverse-transcription step, we were able to detect viral RNA sequences from DENV, ZIKV and HANTV genomes. In all cases, assay run time was less than two hours. Additionally, we report attomolar levels of detection. This methodology was validated using clinical samples from patients infected with Dengue virus. Reactions were visualized by detection of a fluorescent signal, as well as by the use of a simple lateral flow strip. These results indicate that Cas12a is able to detect both DNA and RNA targets, making it an appropriate and convenient tool to detect all types of pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>molecular diagnostic</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas12a</kwd><kwd>RNA viruses</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Worldwide disease outbreaks have exposed the need for and challenges associated with the development of diagnostic tests, specifically infections caused by viral and multidrug-resistant bacteria (commonly known as superbugs). The incidence of newly emerged or re-emerging infectious diseases, global antimicrobial resistance, and food and environmental contamination continues to increase, especially in underdeveloped countries or resource-limited regions [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop detection technologies with high sensitivity and specificity that can be used for rapid and versatile point-of-care (POC) diagnostic applications. In this context, antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests require minimal equipment and thus provide important benefits for patients located in geographic areas where sophisticated molecular test are not available. On the contrary, they show limited sensitivity and specificity, and since they depend on the host antibody response they apply better for epidemiological studies [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To overcome these drawbacks, nucleic acid-based detection methods such as RT&#x02013;PCR have been designed. Although they are sensitive and rapidly adaptable, most require extensive sample manipulation and expensive machinery making it impossible to implement in underdeveloped countries [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>CRISPR-Cas effector nucleases have been used for many biotechnological applications [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Within the CRISPR-Cas effectors family, Cas12a (previously called Cpf1) is an RNA-guided DNase belonging to the class II Type V-A system [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cas12a mediates robust specific RNA-guided double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage and it was recently discovered that it triggers an indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This &#x0201c;collateral activity&#x0201d; was promptly employed to develop a sensitive, specific and rapid method for nucleic acid detection. CRISPR-Cas12a has been used to detect viruses and discriminate human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in either virus-infected human cell lines and clinical patient samples, and also for SNP genotyping [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At the same time, a CRISPR-Cas13-based nucleic acid detection system successfully detected Zika and Dengue viruses (ZIKV, DENV), bacterial isolates, antibiotic-resistant genes, human DNA genotypes, and cancer mutations [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the application of Cas12a for detecting both DNA and RNA pathogens was not hitherto reported.</p><p>In this work, we show that the Cas12a endonuclease could be employed for detecting both DNA and, indirectly, RNA targets such as antibiotic-resistant genes, tropical Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses and endemic (HANTV) viruses, demonstrating the versatility of this platform regardless of the nature of nucleic acid (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic description of CRISPR-Cas detection protocol. To detect a DNA target sequence, a specific isothermal amplification step is first required. In the case of a RNA target, this step needs to be complemented with a reverse transcription reaction. A sgRNA sequence is specially designed, matching a region in the target DNA or cDNA. After the enzyme is loaded with the sgRNA, the amplicon is mixed with the Cas12a/sgRNA complex. A ternary complex only forms if the target DNA is present in the sample. Upon formation of the ternary complex, the quenched fluorescent ssDNA reporter is trans-cleaved, triggering a fluorescence signal that can be monitored with a plate reader. Alternatively, a FAM-Biotin labelled ssDNA reporter could be used, and results visualized with a lateral flow readout.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic specific-use="web-only" content-type="color" xlink:href="TEMI_A_1763857_F0001_OC"/><graphic specific-use="print-only" content-type="black-white" xlink:href="TEMI_A_1763857_F0001_PB"/></alternatives></fig></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials methods" id="S002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S002-S2001"><title>Design and synthesis of nucleic acid targets and sgRNA</title><p>DNA targets, from 200 up to 450&#x02005;bp, were designed using a conserved zone of the sequence of the carbapenemase-encoding genes as a reference, available at the GenBank-NCBI database (KPC NC_014312.1; NDM, NC_023908.1; OXA-48, NC_019154.1).

Results showed that the expected genomic target sequences could be detected for both viruses (<xref rid="F0009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).

Of a total of 8 clinical samples tested by RT-qPCR, 6 had been previously confirmed positive (#1-6), and 2 (# 7 and 8) corresponded to healthy donors without antecedents of DENV infection, and therefore expectedly negative.

However, regardless of their nature, targets can be interconverted during nucleic acid amplification (e.g. DNA to RNA by transcription or RNA to DNA by reverse-transcription), enabling these systems to detect both DNA and RNA targets. As far as we know, no other works have reported the use of Cas12a to detect DNA or RNA targets the way we describe here.</p><p>The entire process of CRISPR-Cas-detection systems includes sample pre-treatment, nucleic acid amplification, CRISPR/Cas-mediated binding/cleavage, and signal detection. The total time required for each method varies from 2&#x02013;5 h for SHERLOCK and about 2 h for DETECTR [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here we show that in less than 2 h, detection could be done reaching attomolar levels. Regarding sample treatment, incubation times depend on the types sample and could be as short as 10&#x02005;min, as demonstrated for blood samples with the HOLMES test [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The speed of nucleic acid amplification strongly correlates with the selected method, where RPA methods need only 15&#x02013;60&#x02005;min. The Cas-mediated reaction is the key step in CRISPR/Cas-based detection, and the assay time is 1 h for DETECTR, and 30&#x02005;min to 3 h for SHERLOCK, mostly depending on the selected Cas effectors [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here, we showed that shorter incubation times can be used for signal detection. If a plate reader is used, measurements are obtained every 2 min and the trend is already manifested within 10 min.</p><p>In this work, we were able to detect synthetic targets, in some cases up to picomolar levels without a previous step of isothermal amplification. When we incorporated isothermal amplification into our workflow, the LoD was lowered to attomolar levels in all targets. Other authors reach the same sensitivity for different targets [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or using different endonucleases [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Interestingly, since this method attains attomolar levels of target detection, we reach clinically relevant detection levels [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In terms of antimicrobial resistance, with the increase of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE), the treatment of severe bacterial infections has become more difficult, especially in regions of high prevalence. Among the different carbapenemases, OXA &#x003b2;-Lactamases (OXA), <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> carbapenemase (KPC), and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) are the most important worldwide [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using the CRISPR-Cas12a system we were able to detect KPC, NDM and OXA genes when present as synthetic targets. Additionally, we tested the cross reaction between these targets. The system is very specific, detecting only the target matching the sgRNA. This is of great importance since carbapenem resistance could be conferred by different genes, which would slow down the medical diagnostics process. Also, we demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas12a platform could detect the KPC gene encoded by a <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolate even in complex samples such as blood, emulating a clinical sample. In this line, the potential of the Cas12a effector to detect targets in patient samples has been recently demonstrated by other authors [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>All published CRISPR-based detection methods intended for bacterial pathogens require pre-treatment of samples to facilitate subsequent amplification and detection. Among these pre-treatments, heating could be the simplest and cheapest procedure; this was used in the HUDSON method prior to the SHERLOCK detection approach, and has demonstrated effectiveness on serum, saliva, and urine samples [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A similar procedure for direct detection in saliva or cell samples before PCR amplification, has been applied for HOLMES [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our system, the combination of chemical and heat treatments exhibited similar results.</p><p>Among different ssRNA viruses, we tested DENV, ZIKV and HANTAV, the latter constituting a novel target for CRISPR/Cas-dependent detection methods. Other methods have been designed for the detection of DENV and ZIKV, such as SHERLOCK. However, this method uses an additional step, reconverting the amplified cDNA into RNA post reverse transcription [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This procedure involves two biochemical reactions, while our Cas12a-based platform only requires one (just converting RNA into cDNA). Therefore, our method is timesaving, especially in the case of RNA targets. Additionally, we demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas12a platform is able to detect ZIKV genomic ssRNA and has the capability of distinguishing between DENV subtypes, which results of high relevance for the patient outcome [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Noteworthy, when the assays were repeated using patient samples, results showed comparable accuracy with those obtained by qRT-PCR, the molecular gold standard. Lastly, our method was adapted to a different reporter system, similar to that employed for pregnancy tests, for which results could be read on commercial lateral flow strips. This type of readout permits an affordable, rapid and precise nucleic acid detection method that can be used almost anywhere. This is particularly important in middle or low-income countries, where expensive equipment for signal detection is not available.</p></sec><sec id="S005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several nucleic acid detection methods have been rapidly developed with various Cas effectors, which could be considered as the tip of the iceberg for this novel biosensing technology in the diagnostics field. Most of these CRISPR/Cas-detecting systems provide several advantages such as simplicity to be developed/re-developed, ultra-high resolution which enables to distinguish single-base variations, and a detection limit attaining at least fM but mostly aM target concentrations. Specifically, our results showed that the Cas12a-effector could be used both with DNA or RNA targets, reducing the steps of the detection process for RNA targets compared with Cas13. In addition, we demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas12 based detection method can be used in a variety of targets in a paper strip without the requirement of sophisticated instrumentation. All in all, we expect that the continuous development of CRISPR/Cas-detection will allow molecular diagnostics to be broadly applied in the near future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM5371"><caption><title>Supplemental Material</title></caption><media xlink:href="TEMI_A_1763857_SM5371.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge INDIEBIO for the support and to Rachel Deraney for her contribution to improve the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="S006"><title>Authors contributions</title><p>LC, CG and FPB designed the experiments.
