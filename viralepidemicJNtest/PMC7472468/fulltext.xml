The disease has a variable clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Many symptomatic patients present with an influenza-like syndrome; however, involvement of other organs including the kidneys has been reported [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the prevalence of acute kidney injury appears to be lower with COVID-19 compared to that seen in other coronavirus infections [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], one study showed that 44% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 had evidence of proteinuria at admission, while 27% had hematuria, and 14% had elevated creatinine, all of which were independent risk factors for in-hospital death [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the precise etiology of renal injury in COVID-19 is incompletely understood, tubular injury secondary to virus-induced cytokines, sepsis, and hypoxia, as well as rhabdomyolysis in some cases, has been postulated [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that injury may also be related to direct viral cytotoxicity. Viral-like particles have been detected in tubular epithelial cells and podocytes by electron microscopy, with corresponding positive staining for SARS-CoV nucleoprotein by immunofluorescence [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, collapsing glomerulopathy (CG) has recently been reported in several patients with COVID-19 in the United States [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref>]. Interestingly, all cases occurred in patients with high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> genotypes, which are associated with increased susceptibility to CG and chronic kidney disease.</p><p>We report on a 42-year-old man who immigrated to the United States in 2019 from India and developed CG associated with COVID-19. The patient had no significant past medical history, but presented to his primary care physician in January 2020 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. He received three courses of antibiotics over the next month, but subsequently developed hypertension and lower extremity edema. Upon referral to nephrology in March, he was afebrile but reported a 10&#x02009;kg weight gain. Laboratory studies revealed a normal serum creatinine (1&#x02009;mg/dL) with nephrotic-range proteinuria (urine protein-creatinine ratio 8&#x02009;g/g) and hematuria by urinalysis. He was additionally found to have hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, and leukopenia without anemia or thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Serologic studies were negative for hepatitis B and C, HIV, double-stranded DNA, and ANA. He had normal complement C3 and C4, and serum protein electrophoreses was unremarkable. The patient was started on lisinopril 10&#x02009;mg and a renal biopsy was ordered. Per protocol, the patient underwent COVID-19 testing by nasal swab prior to the procedure, and was found to be positive. Repeat testing two weeks later by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was again positive. The biopsy was finally performed following a negative test ten days later.</p><table-wrap id="t0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Select Laboratory Results.</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col width="1*"/><col width="1*"/><col width="1*"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Laboratory test</th><th align="center">Patient value</th><th align="center">Reference range</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left">Creatinine</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0.55&#x02212;1.02&#x02009;mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">7&#x02013;25&#x02009;mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Albumin</td><td align="center">1.9</td><td align="center">3.4&#x02013;5&#x02009;g/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cholesterol, total</td><td align="center">329</td><td align="center">0&#x02013;200&#x02009;mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LDL</td><td align="center">239</td><td align="center">0&#x02013;100&#x02009;mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">HDL</td><td align="center">59</td><td align="center">40&#x02013;130&#x02009;mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Calcium</td><td align="center">7.5</td><td align="center">8.5&#x02013;10.1&#x02009;mg/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">WBC count</td><td align="center">2.8</td><td align="center">4.5&#x02013;11 K/&#x000b5;L</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hemoglobin</td><td align="center">15.6</td><td align="center">12&#x02013;16&#x02009;g/dL</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Platelet count</td><td align="center">207</td><td align="center">140&#x02013;440 K/&#x000b5;L</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Spot urine protein/creatine ratio</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">0&#x02013;0.1&#x02009;g/g</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>By light microscopy, several glomeruli demonstrated segmental collapse of the capillary tuft with hyperplasia of overlying epithelial cells, some of which contained prominent protein droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The cortex showed focal acute tubular injury with minimal interstitial inflammatory infiltrates. There was mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with moderate arteriosclerosis. Immunofluorescence studies were negative. Ultrastructural studies showed segmental collapse of the glomerular tuft with numerous enlarged podocytes. Glomerular basement membranes were of normal thickness and texture. There were no immune complex deposits or tubuloreticular inclusions. Podocyte foot processes showed complete effacement. Additionally, numerous spherical particles, measuring between 49 and 102&#x02009;nm in diameter, were identified within the cytoplasm of podocytes. The particles exhibited an electron dense outer rim and were surrounded by spikes measuring 14&#x02013;19&#x02009;nm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). These particles were similar to previously described viral-like particles in COVID-19 [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as well as those identified in cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The biopsy was diagnosed as collapsing glomerulopathy, and the presence of viral-like particles within podocytes was suspicious for COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy. Following the biopsy, infectious disease specialists were consulted; however, the patient did not fit the criteria for emergency use of remdesivir, and was subsequently lost to follow up. Further studies to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the biopsy were not performed.</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Light microscopy.

Most cases have associated acute tubular injury or interstitial nephritis, and some may show microcystic tubular dilation. In addition to primary (idiopathic) FSGS, CG is associated with a number of secondary etiologies. These include infection (e.g., HIV, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus), as well as autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, various malignancies, severe ischemia such as that seen with thrombotic microangiopathy, and drugs like interferon and pamidronate [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Certain genotypes also play a role in the development of CG, particularly the presence of <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles. These <italic>APOL1</italic> variants confer an increased resistance to trypanosomal infection and are found only in individuals of African ancestry, with up to 13% of African-Americans harboring two <italic>APOL1</italic> risk alleles [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Patients with high-risk genotypes are at increased risk of chronic kidney disease and CG, and the majority of patients with CG possess an underlying <italic>APOL1</italic> high-risk genotype [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The precise mechanism through which the podocytes are affected in the setting of <italic>APOL1</italic>-associated CG has not been completely elucidated; however, in many cases cytokine-induced injury is thought to play a major role. In addition, viruses such as HIV and parvovirus B19 may also directly target cells within the kidney, resulting in podocyte injury and contributing to the development of CG [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Of the previously reported cases of COVID-19-associated CG, viral-like particles were identified within podocyte vacuoles of one patient; however, PCR performed on frozen tissue for SARS-CoV-2 was negative [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The remaining cases demonstrated no direct evidence of viral infection, although tubuloreticular inclusions were identified in one case [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All patients were found to possess <italic>APOL1</italic> high-risk genotypes. Additionally, the previously reported patients all required hospitalization for pulmonary and renal dysfunction. In contrast, our patient had a relatively mild clinical course, not requiring hospitalization, and compared to the other cases, the biopsy showed less exuberant collapsing lesions with milder tubular injury. There were no tubuloreticular inclusions by electron microscopy, but viral-like particles consistent with coronavirus in size and appearance were readily identified within podocytes [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Serologic workup for underlying autoimmune and infectious etiologies was negative, including repeat HIV testing following the biopsy. Importantly, as a recent immigrant from India, the patient is highly unlikely to possess a high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> genotype. While additional testing was not performed, the presence of viral-like particles within podocytes in this patient who otherwise carries no risk factors for CG raises suspicion for direct viral toxicity of podocytes.</p><p>To our knowledge, this represents the first case of COVID-19-associated CG in a patient with no predisposing risk factors for CG. While the presence of <italic>APOL1</italic> high-risk genotypes likely contributes to the development of CG in many COVID-19 patients, presence of viral-like particles in this case raises the possibility that the virus plays a more significant role in the development of CG than previously indicated, either through direct viral toxicity or cytokine-induced injury. Further investigation into the development of CG in the setting of COVID-19 is critical in order to gain a better understanding of patient outcomes and determine optimal management for affected individuals.</p></body><back><sec id="S0001" disp-level="1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Su</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <etal>et&#x000a0;al.</etal></person-group>
