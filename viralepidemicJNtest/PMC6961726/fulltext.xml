Now, we showed EV71 could be spread non-lytically between cells during early viral infection. In order to explain this phenomenon, we separated supernatant fluids of rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells cultures infected with EV71 by isopycnic gradient centrifugation. Two populations of virus particles were morphology indistinguishable by transmission electron microscope (TEM). It showed that some EV71 particles were wrapped inside extracellular vesicles which were verified to be exosomes by immunoassay and morphologic analysis. In addition, exosomes containing viral RNA were shed in plasma of EV71-infected encephalitis in children.

The EV71 particle is symmetrical with a 20&#x02013;30 nm icosahedral capsid. EV71 is considered as a classic non-enveloped virus which had to be spread after lysis of host cells. It can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) which is usually self-limiting but highly contagious in children under 5 years old [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. In addition to HFMD, EV71 has been shown to have the ability to infect the central nervous system (CNS) and can cause various neurological complications, including aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, neurogenic pulmonary edema, delayed neurodevelopment, and reduced cognitive function [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. It has been proposed that there are two possible routes by which EV71 reaches the CNS: the virus either enters the CNS from the blood across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or is transmitted to the CNS through peripheral nerves via retrograde axonal transport [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. As for the first route, concerning the vehicle for the virus, although the viral RNA could be detected in leukocytes, the majority of the infectious virions in the bloodstream were present in the plasma, indicating that infecting leukocytes was probably not the vehicles for transportation into the CNS. The EV71 carrier from the bloodstream towards the nervous system is still largely unknown.</p><p>Exosomes (30-150nm) are one subtype of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted into extracellular space by most cells. The exosomes can transmit their contents, such as protein, lipid, and RNAs, to recipient cells or distal tissues and participate in various biological processes [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. In addition to performing many biological functions [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>], exosomes could transfer viral components including viral RNA, proteins and other host functional genetic elements between cells. The role of exosomes in viral infection usually depends upon the cells of origin. Besides, several non-envelop viruses, poliovirus, hepatitis A and coxsackievirus B3 have also been identified in EVs being released from intact cells [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. However, to date, whether the EV71 virions were wrapped in the exosomes are undetermined. The exosomeal content and the exosomal contributions to the pathogenesis of EV71 remain largely unexplored.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that EV71 virions could be internally enclosed in the exosomes (EXO-EV71) <italic>in vitro</italic> which may play an important role in viral dissemination. Moreover, we show that EV71 RNA could be detected in the exosomes (EXO-EV71-RNA) which were isolated from the plasma of EV71-infected encephalitis in children. These findings are the first to elucidate the intact EV71 virions were transported in the exosomes, provide new insights to the pathogenic mechanisms of EV71.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>RD cells (human rhabdomyosarcoma cells) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

One population was at a low density (1.10&#x02013;1.12 g cm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, fraction 7&#x02013;8) consistent with small extracellular vesicles, whereas the other population (fraction 4&#x02013;5) was at the density expected for EV71 (1.18&#x02013;1.26 g cm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>).</p><p>Notably, two populations showed different morphologies.

The result indicated that CD63 on the exosomal membrane was digested by proteinase K but the membrane-binding protein TSG101 and viral protein VP1 were protected from proteinase K in the exosomes. However, addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 which disrupted the lipid membrane of the exosomes resulted in completed digestion of all protein (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(f</xref>)).

In fact, it is not clear whether the exosomes contain intact virions yet. Compared with these previous studies, now we used a better method: isopycnic gradient centrifugation with high specificity to separate exosomes from supernatant according to the guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. We found intact EV71 virions could be wrapped within exosomes which were verified by TEM, NTA, immunoblotting, and digestion of proteinase K.</p><p>Upon infection, viral RNA is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to induce host immunity and inflammation. During EV71 infection, the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) facilitates the TLR7 complex assembly, leading to the induction of inflammatory and immune responses [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. An in-depth analysis of the plasmablast-derived IgG mAbs from EV71-infected children unraveled the epitopes for the neutralizing antibodies induced by natural infection [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. Wu et al proposed that the full particle (FP) VP1 subunit in the EV71 vaccines was the major immunogen conferring wide-range neutralizing efficacy. However, it has implied that the exosomes derived from EV71-infected cell are partially resisted to antibody neutralization [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. Considering EXO-EV71, further investigations into the prophylactic and therapeutic methods targeting the infectious exosomes should be done in the future.</p><p>In addition, our findings showed exosomes containing EV71 RNA (EXO-EV71-RNA) circulated in encephalitis patients&#x02019; plasma, although EV71 could migrate to the brainstem via retrograde axonal transport [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>] and prohibitin (PHB) was involved in the entry of EV71 virus into motoneuron cells, where EV71 could enter the CNS [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. There may be multiple routes used for EV71 to enter the nervous system, because EV71 that shed into the bloodstream also might invade the CNS across the BBB. There are increasing studies suggested EVs including exosomes could cross the BBB [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. Based on this, we hypothesize that the exosomal pathway maybe have a partial role in neuropathogenesis of EV71 infection. Further investigations are necessary to determine the relevance between EXO-EV71-RNA and CNS infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show a previously unknown mechanism of EV71 egress from infected cells. These findings that EXO-EV71 was secreted from infected cells and EXO-EV71-RNA was in patients&#x02019; plasma provide new insight into further studies of the function of EXO-EV71 in EV71-infected neurological complications. It is an enlightenment for us to consider the function and mechanism(s) of exosomes in viral CNS infection, though the detail conjectures require further study for confirmation.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><sec id="S0006"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The collection of all the samples and clinical information were approved by the Ethics Committee of Jiangsu University and Xuzhou Children&#x02019;s Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of all children.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>YJ</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name>, et al</person-group>
